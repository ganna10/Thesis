The first forming NO2 , hence propagating tropospheric O3 formation; the second channel leads to the production of an organic nitrate (RONO2 ) via a complex rearrangement, the exact mechanism of which    is still uncertain (Dibble, 2008).  RONO2 allows O3 precursors to be transported over great distances owing to their much longer atmospheric lifetime than NO2. &#xa;"/>
<node CREATED="1421755053339" ID="ID_997990931" MODIFIED="1421755091718" TEXT="Broadly speaking the RO2 + NO  reaction can be classed as the most important of the RO2 loss reactions to include for modelling O3 production in the troposphere. The products of the reaction between RO2 and HO2 depend strongly on the structure of the RO2 (Orlando and Tyndall, 2012).  Traditionally the reaction between RO2 and HO2 has been thought of as a radical  sink, hence limiting the propagation of RO2 + NO reactions and so reducing the po-  tential O3 production. The major product of this reaction for an alkyl RO2 (R&#x2019;RCHOO)    is an organic hydroperoxide (ROOH), a compound that is predicted to be lost from the atmosphere via deposition or aqueous uptake faster than its photodissocation can reform precursor radicals. The kinetics of the self (RO2 + RO2 ) and cross reactions (RO2 + R O2 ) of RO2 (see Sect. 3.5 of Orlando and Tyndall, 2012 for references) limit the importance of these reactions to laboratory studies and parts of the atmosphere where concentrations of RO2 are high (e.g. high BVOC emission regions).

RO are produced almost exclusively as products of the reactions of RO2 with NO. In general RO are very reactive and either undergo unimolecular decomposition (on the time scale of miliseconds) or react with O2 producing HO2 radicals. (Monks 2012)"/>
