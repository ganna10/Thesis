In many areas around the world, air pollution is the leading environmental health risk affecting both the human population and ecology.
The effects of air pollution range from chronic to less severe health impacts to the general population, air pollution has been labelled carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer \citep{IARC:2013}, significant economic impacts due to reduced growth rates of vegetation run into billions of euros per year.
Due to these impacts, many governed areas introduced limit values for the most common and severe air pollutants \citep{AQEU:2015}.

Air pollutants can be emitted directly into the atmosphere (\emph{primary pollutants}) or formed from the chemical reactions of other pollutants (\emph{secondary pollutants}).
Over Europe, particulate matter (PM) and tropospheric ozone (\ce{O3}) are the most problematic with up to $93$ and $98$~\% of Europe's urban population exposed to concentrations above the WHO guidelines \citep{AQEU:2015}.

Tackling the high levels of tropospheric ozone is a complex problem as it is secondary pollutant formed from the reactions of emitted nitrogen oxides (\ce{NO_x}~$\equiv$~NO + \ce{NO2}) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight.
The photochemical nature of ozone production also lends itself to large impacts from meteorological variables such as temperature and wind speed \citep{Jacob:2009}.
Despite reductions to ozone precursors, the EU target value for human health (the EU does not currently have a  limit value for ozone) was exceeded in $65$~\% of the EU member states and Europe's target value for vegetation was exceeded in $27$~\% of the EU-28 agricultural areas \citep{AQEU:2013}.

Air quality (AQ) modelling is an important tool for predicting future air quality under different emission and meteorological scenarios.
Adequately representing the complexity of ozone production is an ongoing challenge for the modelling community.
Representing the numerous inputs in a correct way that is computationally efficient to reproduce observed trends in tropospheric ozone is a challenge for AQ models.

In this work, we shall determine the effects of different representations of specific model inputs on simulated ozone production.
The research questions addressed in this work, relate specifically to the representation of chemistry, inputs of VOC emissions and temperature on ozone production and are detailed further in Sect.~\ref{s:research_questions}.
After determining the effects on ozone production, Chap.~\ref{c:conclusions} frames these effects in the wider view of improving current state of the art AQ modelling of tropospheric ozone.

\section{Ozone} \label{s:ozone}
%atmospheric O3 with budget, lifetime, stratospheric & tropospheric ozone
Ozone is a constituent gas of the atmosphere found in the stratosphere and troposphere, however its atmospheric effects are very different in these distinct regions.
About 90~\% of the atmospheric ozone is present in the stratosphere with a peak mixing ratio of about $12$~ppm \citep{Seinfeld:2006}.
Stratospheric ozone absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths between $280$ and $315$~nm, this is extremely important as excess UV radiation may cause skin cancer, cataracts and a suppressed immune system in humans and can also damage land and aquatic ecosystems \citep{WMO:2010}. 

In contrast, tropospheric ozone, found close to the surface, is both a pollutant and a greenhouse gas. 
Increased levels of tropospheric ozone are harmful to humans, plants and other living systems, as high ozone exposure can lead to pulmonary problems in humans and can decrease both crop yields and forest growth \citep{WMO:2010}. 

Globally, tropospheric ozone is formed mainly via photochemical production from the reactions of emitted VOCs and \ce{NO_x}.
However, the Statospere-Troposphere Exchange (STE), which transports ozone from the stratosphere into the troposphere, may also play a role. 
The STE is driven by the Brewer-Dobson circulation \citep{Brewer:1949, Dobson:1956}, a relatively slow circulation (weeks to months) due to planetary wave disturbances in the troposphere \citep{Haynes:1991}.
The circulation causes air to move downward from the stratosphere into the troposphere at the mid and high latitudes and is balanced by upward exchange at the tropics. 
%The STE also has a seasonal variability where the maximum transport occurs during spring \citep{Appenzeller:1996}, due to the increase in altitude of the tropopause - the boundary level between the troposphere and the stratosphere - which moves stratospheric air into the troposphere. 

A spring-time peak in \ce{O3} concentrations is common in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and the STE was thought to be responsible. 
However, it is only very rarely that \ce{O3} originating via STE can influence tropospheric \ce{O3} levels \citep{Lelieveld:2000}. 
It was later realised that this spring maximum is due to the photochemical reactions occuring in the Northern Hemisphere spring after the buildup of reservoir species over winter \citep{Penkett:1986}.
These reservoir species are oxidised photochemically at a faster rate due to the increase in temperature, moisture and sunlight.

%metereology impacts 
Tropospheric \ce{O3} is not only impacted by emission levels, it is also affected by meteorological variables such as temperature, number of hours of sunshine and wind as these impact transport, dry and wet deposition rates and also chemical reaction rates \citep{Hess:2009}.
Meteorology influences both regional and global \ce{O3} \citep{Hess:2009}, climate patterns such as El Ni\~{n}o are also known to impact \ce{O3} levels in certain areas \citep{Sudo:2001}. 
The effects of meteorology on ozone production shall be presented in more detail in Sect.~\ref{s:meteo_ozone}.

In general, there has been great effort to reduce emissions of ozone precursors from anthropogenic sources.
For example, the emissions of non-methane VOCs (NMVOCs) over Europe have decreased by $20$~\% and emissions of \ce{NO_x} have decreased by almost $30$~\% from 2004 levels.
Despite these reductions in ozone precursors, up to $98$~\% of Europe's urban population are exposed to levels of ozone exceeding the WHO guidelines \citep{AQEU:2015}.

Modelling of \ce{O3} production has played a part in understanding the complexity of atmospheric chemistry, such as the non-linear relationship of \ce{O3} production on the concentrations of VOCs and \ce{NO_x}.
The results of these modelling experiments can be used to produce more effective strategies for reducing ozone levels.
The need for more effective air quality standards in turn also drives the model development and deeper understanding of the atmospheric processes controlling ozone production.
In this work, we shall address the representation of three important parts of an AQ model (chemistry, NMVOC emissions and meteorology) and their impacts on simulated ozone production.

\section{Ozone Production Chemistry} \label{s:ozone_chemistry}
%O3 chemical sources & sinks, linking VOCs.
Ozone is chemically produced and destroyed through the null photochemical cycle involving nitrogen dioxide (\ce{NO2}) and nitrogen oxide (NO) in Reactions~\eqref{r:NO2_hv}, \eqref{r:O_O2} and \eqref{r:NO_O3}.
This null cycle produces net ozone with the presence of VOCs of both biogenic and anthropogenic origin in the atmosphere. 
Secondary degradation products of the emitted VOCs, in the presence of \ce{NO_x}, react with NO to produce \ce{NO2}.
In the presence of sunlight, the newly-formed \ce{NO2} photolyses via \eqref{r:NO2_hv} producing ozone through \eqref{r:O_O2}.
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{NO2 + h\nu} & \rightarrow \ce{NO + O(^3P)} \label{r:NO2_hv} \\
    \ce{O(^3P) + O2} & \xrightarrow[]{\text{\tiny{M}}} \ce{O3} \label{r:O_O2} \\
    \ce{NO + O3} & \rightarrow \ce{NO2 + O2} \label{r:NO_O3}
\end{rxnarray}

%atmospheric chemistry of NMVOCs 
Many thousands of VOCs are emitted into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and biogenic sources, discussed further in Sect.~\ref{s:precursor_emissions}. 
Despite the vast array of VOCs, there are many common features between the degradation pathways.
Figure~\ref{f:VOC_reaction} represents a general and simplified reaction scheme for VOCs in the troposphere. 
\begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{center}
        \caption[Schematic of general secondary degradation of VOCs]{Schematic diagram outlining general pathways of the secondary degradation of an emitted VOC.}
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{VOC_degradation}
        \label{f:VOC_reaction}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The primary oxidation of a VOC is typically through reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical.
Ozone also plays an important role in the production of OH radicals.
The photolysis of ozone \eqref{r:O3_hv} at wavelengths less than $335$~nm produces excited oxygen atoms (\ce{O^1D}) which when reacting with water vapour produce OH \eqref{r:O1D_H2O}.
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{O3 + h\nu} & \rightarrow \ce{O2 + O^1D} \label{r:O3_hv} \\
    \ce{O^1D + H2O} & \rightarrow \ce{2 OH} \label{r:O1D_H2O}
\end{rxnarray}

The reaction of a VOC with OH forms an alkyl or substituted alkyl radical (R) which in the presence of \ce{O2} produces alkyl peroxy radicals (\ce{RO2}).
Unsaturated VOCs, such as alkenes, may also react with ozone while photolysis is a primary degradation pathways for carbonyl species.
During the night-time, reaction with the \ce{NO3} radical is of importance.
These initial reaction pathways all lead to the formation of \ce{RO2} radicals.
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{VOC + OH / NO3 / O3 / h\nu} & \rightarrow \ce{R} \label{r:VOC_init} \\
    \ce{R + O2} & \rightarrow \ce{RO2} \label{r:R_O2}
\end{rxnarray} 

\ce{RO2} radicals can subsequently react with NO, \ce{NO2}, hydroperoxy (\ce{HO2}) radicals, \ce{NO3} radicals - mainly during night-time - and with other alkyl peroxy radicals \citep{Atkinson:2000}. 
The competition between these reactions, especially those pathways involving \ce{NO_x} (\eqref{r:RO2_NOa}, \eqref{r:RO2_NOa} and \eqref{r:RO2_NO2}), determines the amount of net production or loss of ozone. 
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{RO2 + NO} & \xrightarrow[]{\text{M}} \ce{RONO2} \label{r:RO2_NOa} \\
    \ce{RO2 + NO} & \rightarrow \ce{RO + NO2} \label{r:RO2_NOb} \\
    \ce{RO2 + NO2} & \xrightleftharpoons[]{\text{M}} \ce{RO2NO2} \label{r:RO2_NO2} \\
    \ce{RO2 + HO2} & \rightarrow \ce{ROOH + O2} \label{r:RO2_HO2} \\
    \ce{RO2 + NO3} & \rightarrow \ce{RO + NO2 + O2} \label{r:RO2_NO3} \\
    \ce{RO2 + RO2} & \rightarrow \ce{2RO + O2} \label{r:RO2_RO2a} \\
    \ce{RO2 + RO2} & \rightarrow \ce{RCH(OH)R + RC(O)R + O2} \label{r:RO2_RO2b}
\end{rxnarray}
All reactions pathways of \ce{RO2} that produce \ce{NO2} can result in \ce{O3} formation due to \eqref{r:NO2_hv} and \eqref{r:O_O2}. 
Reaction with the \ce{HO2} radical forms a hydroperoxide (ROOH) which then photolyses producing an alkoxy (RO) radical and recycling an OH radical.
The carbonyl and alcohol products resulting from reaction with other \ce{RO2} radicals will follow a similar sequence of reactions and hence can also produce further \ce{O3}. 
Thus the secondary degradation products of a VOC may also lead to further production of ozone.

Reaction of \ce{RO2} with \ce{NO2} leads to the formation of peroxynitrates (\ce{RO2NO2}) which are a temporary reservoir for \ce{RO2} and \ce{NO_x}.
When temperatures are low, the thermal decomposition of \ce{RO2NO2} to recycle \ce{RO2} and \ce{NO_x} happens at a slower rate than at higher temperatures.
Hence, at lower temperatures these \ce{RO2NO2} may build up and be transported away from their region of formation and re-release \ce{RO2} and \ce{NO2} downwind fuelling ozone production away from large sources of \ce{NO_x}.
This is one example of the dependence of ozone production on meteorogological variables, a broader overview is given in Sect.~\ref{s:meteo_ozone}.

The secondary degradation of the RO radical formed from many of the \ce{RO2} reactions proceeds through either decomposition, isomerisation or reaction with \ce{O2}. 
The products that result from the reaction pathways depend on the parent VOC and this also determines the number of NO-to-\ce{NO2} conversions, eventually leading to \ce{O3} formation.

The final degradation products of VOCs are carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}) and water vapour. 
The path that each VOC takes to reach its final products is dependent on the type of VOC, the radical concentration, the \ce{NO_x} concentration and other factors such as time of day and year. 
The detailed atmospheric chemistry of most VOCs is well-understood however for more complex VOCs the complete set of reaction pathways of all the secondary degradation products there are a great number of uncertainties. 
These uncertainties may be related to kinetic data, photolysis rates, reaction branching ratios and in most cases the reaction products.
Any uncertainties in reaction pathways and products of VOCs also leads to uncertainties in estimating the amount of ozone produced during the degradation of a particular VOC \citep{Atkinson:2000}.

Representing this complex chemistry for each emitted VOC in a chemical transport model (CTM) is unrealistic.
Even if all the secondary degradation pathways and products were known for every VOC, a CTM would not be able to efficiently numerically solve the resulting differential equations.
Hence, CTMs use descriptions of atmospheric chemistry that lead to more computationally efficient models.

Not all representations of atmospheric chemistry used in a \emph{chemical mechanism} are prepared in the same way.
For a start, models that also numerically compute meteorology fields require very computationally efficient chemical mechanisms including around $150$ unique species while simpler box models can use chemical mechanisms having many thousands of species.
The simplification techniques used to represent the multitude of VOC and their degradation may lead to discrepancies in the estimations of ozone production.
We compare the ozone production from many reduced chemical mechanisms to a highly detailed chemical mechanism in Sect.~\ref{s:chemical_mechanism_results} and the research questions addressed in this study are framed in Sect.~\ref{s:research_questions}.

%balance of NOx & NMVOC for O3 production
One of the most important features of ozone production, briefly hinted at prevously, is the dependence of ozone levels on both VOC and \ce{NO_x}.
Figure~\ref{f:O3_isopleth}, from \citet{Jenkin:2000}, depicts the non-linear relationship between \ce{O3} mixing ratios as a function of VOC and \ce{NO_x} mixing ratios.  
This relationship can be divided into distinct regimes of ozone production: \emph{\ce{NO_x}-sensitive} (or \emph{\ce{NO_x}-limited}), \emph{\ce{NO_x}-saturated} (or \emph{VOC-sensitive}) and \emph{VOC-and-\ce{NO_x}-sensitive} regimes. 

The cause of the non-linear relationship is the pathways available to \ce{RO2}.
In the \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime, the concentration of \ce{NO_x} is low compared to that of radicals hence radicals are more likely to react with other radicals. 
The most common reactions are bimolecular destruction \eqref{r:HO2_OH}, which removes radicals, or combination of radicals \eqref{r:RO2_HO2} into reservoir species that can re-release radicals.
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{HO2 + OH} \rightarrow \ce{H2O + O2} \label{r:HO2_OH}
\end{rxnarray}

Reactions between radicals do not directly lead to ozone production as little NO is converted to \ce{NO2}.
Thus increasing \ce{NO_x} would increase the number of NO to \ce{NO2} reactions by peroxy radicals leading to ozone production.
However, increasing VOC levels would not increase \ce{O3} production as increases the likelihood of radical descruction or combination reactions.

The \ce{NO_x}-saturated regime corresponds to high \ce{NO_x} concentrations where radicals will tend to react with \ce{NO_x}. 
Increased \ce{NO_x} levels will not increase \ce{O3} production due to an increase in nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}) formation \eqref{r:NO2_OH}.
Nitric acid is a sink for both OH and \ce{NO_x} removing OH which would otherwise react with emitted VOC to fuel further radical production.
\begin{rxnarray}
    \ce{NO2 + OH} \rightarrow \ce{HNO3} \label{r:NO2_OH}
\end{rxnarray}

The VOC-and-\ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime is characterised by \ce{O3} production being sensitive to both VOC and \ce{NO_x} levels. 
Morever, it is in this atmospheric regime that the maximum amount of ozone is produced and corresponds to the contour ridges in Fig.~\ref{f:O3_isopleth}.
The non-linear relationship can be thought of as a titration process between the amount of radicals and the \ce{NO_x} present in the atmosphere with the VOC-and-\ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime being the turning point \citep{Kleinman:1991, Kleinman:1994}.

This non-linear nature of the troposphere to ozone production makes controlling ozone levels particularly difficult.
The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that regions can alternate between these regimes depending on the season, time of day etc.
Moreover, fresh emissions tend to occur in the \ce{NO_x}-saturated regime and through transport, the emissions are advected to VOC-and\ce{NO_x}-sensitive and even \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regions.

\section{Emissions of Ozone Precursors} \label{s:precursor_emissions}
% NOx sources and quantities, weekend effect

%VOCs, types of VOCs and source (A vs B)

%representation of VOC emissions in models using emission inventories
The sources of the alkanes listed below are natural gases, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), combustion and industry, for the case of octane, vehicle exhaust is also a source. 
Alkene sources are mainly due to industrial activities and vehicular emissions. 
Aromatic compounds are mainly due to vehicle emissions, while benzene and toluene are also emitted due to industrial activity and combustion is also a further source for benzene \citep{Arsene:2009}.

Moreover, the precursors of ozone are linked to anthropogenic activity, hence a so-called weekend effect (i.e. there is a reduction on \ce{O3} concentration over the weekend) is also evident (see for example, \citep{Koo:2012}). 

\section{Effects of Meteorology on Ozone Production} \label{s:meteo_ozone}

The effect of meteorology is an aspect of atmospheric chemical transport modelling that needs to be taken into account. 
However it is also frequently the major source of uncertainty for the calculated \ce{O3} concentrations. 
Wind speeds in particular may lead to under- or over-predicated values of \ce{O3} concentrations \citep{Sillman:1999}. 

Discuss effects of meteorology on reservoir species which influences ozone production.
