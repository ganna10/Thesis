Tim for giving me the opportunity to perform the work. Starting with a noob and bringing them to a Doctoral level speaks highly of you. The criticism only helped me complete the work. Sense of humour helped out and we also make a good basis for a successful pub quiz team!

Mark and IASS, the financial and scientific support of the project. Working at the IASS not only helped me develop my expertise in atmospheric chemistry modelling but frame it in a way that could be beneficial for societal transformation.

FUB for allowing me to completed my studies. In particular Prof. Peter Builtjes for being supportative of the collaboration between IASS and FUB and my work. Your pleasant comments and input during the PAC meetings is greatly appreciated.

IASS Colleagues, my scientific grounding could not have happened without the numerous colleagues, past and present, who helped in general discussions, translating, running, coffee breaks.

Nadja, sitting through trial presentations, proofreading, unwaivering support, coffee and baked goodies, I'm always available for quality control.
