First and foremost, I would like to thank Tim Butler. 
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to pursue my PhD, bringing me up to speed on the skills I needed for the work and always being there to offer advice. 
I also appreciate the criticism which helped me improve my work, your sense of humour and that we make a good basis for a successful pub quiz team!

I would like to thank Mark Lawrence and the IASS for scientific and financial support of the project.
Working at the IASS helped me develop the mindset of applying scientific research within the wider framework of societal transformation. 
I could not have truely appreciated this without working at the IASS and the guidance of Mark Lawrence.

I thank Peter Builtjes for the collaboration and support during the project.
Your pleasant comments and input during the many PAC meetings were greatly appreciated.

Thanks also goes to all my colleagues, past and present, at the IASS.
All the discussions, translations, runs around the lake and coffee breaks helped me get through this time!

Last but not least, I must thank Nadja Menz: you have sat through so many trial presentations, proofread texts and supplied an adequate amount of coffee and baked goodies to fuel me through this work. 
For your unwaivering support that takes on many forms - thanks!
