This chapter describes the methods and materials used to address the research questions of the study (Sect.~\ref{s:research_questions}).
Details of the modelling set-up, including initial and boundary conditions are included in this chapter.

\section{Air Quality Modelling} \label{s:modelling}
Models are either Eulerian or Lagrangian, with Eulerian models constituting most of the models used by the AQ modelling community \citep{Russell:2000}.
Eulerian models describe the atmosphere using fixed grid-boxes where species enter in and out of the boxes and the species concentrations are calculated as a function of time. 
While Lagrangian models simulate changes of selected air parcels during advection through the atmosphere, thus there is no exchange between the surroundings and the air parcel (besides emissions) and the model calculates concentrations at different locations and times \citep{Seinfeld:2006}. 

Photochemical models also have different dimensions, ranging from zero-dimensional (box model) to three-dimensional models where the simplicity and computing power increase with model dimension.
Box models are the simplest type of a model having uniform atmospheric concentrations that are only a function of time \citep{Seinfeld:2006}.
Box models lack realism but are extremely useful for studying the detailed processes that influence air quality.
Examples of modelling studies that have used box models include \citet{Bin:2007} and \citet{Noelscher:2014}.

Models numerically solve the chemical species conservation equation describing the processes affecting the concentration of chemical species:
\begin{equation} \label{e:conc}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial t} \hspace{2mm} + \hspace{2mm} \nabla \cdot \bar{U}c_i \hspace{2mm} = \hspace{2mm} \nabla \rho D \nabla(c_i/\rho) \hspace{2mm} + \hspace{2mm} R_i(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n, T, t) \\ + \hspace{2mm} S_i(\bar{x}, t), \hspace{5mm} i = 1, 2, \dots, n.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
In Eq.~\eqref{e:conc}, $c_i$ is the concentration (in mass or volume) of species $i$, $\bar{U}$ is the wind velocity vector, $D_i$ is the molecular diffusivity of species $i$, $R_i$ is the rate of concentration change of species $i$ through chemical reactions and may be a function of meteorological variables such as temperature.
$S_i(\bar{x}, t)$ is the source or sink of $i$ at location $\bar{x}$, $\rho$ is the air density and $n$ is the number of predicted species.
\citep{Russell:2000}

The dimension and type of model determines the set of differential equations solved at each time step of the model run. 
Numerical methods used to determine the concentration of species $i$ in Eq.~\eqref{e:conc} vary between models, examples include Runge-Kutta \citep{Sandu:1997b}, Finite Element \citep{Russell:2000} or Rosenbrock methods \citep{Sandu:1997a}.

Initial and boundary conditions are required to solve the system of differential equations.
Boundary conditions require knowledge of the concentration and transport of species $i$ at the boundary edges of the model grid.
While initial conditions fix the starting concentration of each species $i$.

\subsection{Model Description and Setup} \label{ss:model_setup}
The MECCA (Module Efficiently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere) box model was used throughout this work to study the detailed processes influencing the production of ozone.
MECCA was developed by \citet{Sander:2005} and adapted to include MCM~v3.1 chemistry by \citet{Butler:2011}.
The chemical mechanisms used with MECCA in this work are outlined in Sect.~\ref{s:chemical_mechanisms}.
The MECCA box model has been used for studies in modelling of atmospheric gas-phase chemistry including \citet{Kubistin:2010} and \citet{Lourens:2016}.

MECCA is written using the Fortran programming language and runs on UNIX/Linux platforms.
The setup of MECCA that we used uses KPP (Kinetic Pre-Processor) \citep{Damian:2002} to efficiently setup up the system of differential equations for each species considered (Eq.~\eqref{e:conc}).
KPP processes the specified chemistry scheme in the chemical mechanism and generates Fortran code that is then compilied by MECCA.
KPP has many choices of numerical solver for solving the differential equations, a Rosenbrock solver (the ros3 option) throughout this work.

Aside from the chemistry, MECCA also calculates physical parameters at every time step of the simulations.
In our simulations, the pressure, temperature, relative humidity and boundary layer height are held constant at the set values of Table~\ref{t:model_setup}.

Photolysis rates in this study are paramaterised as a function of the solar zenith angle.
This paramaterisation requires the degree of latitude for the study to be a defined variable in MECCA, we have chosen the $34\degree$ N latitude which is roughly that of the city of Los Angeles.
and changed to ? in the temperature-ozone study.
The simulations start at the spring equinox (27th March) at 6am and allowed to run for seven diurnal cycles.
or 2 days for final study.

All fluxes of the chemical species into and out of the box are handled by KPP.
The chemical mechanism file includes pseudo-unimolecular reactions specifying the emissions and dry deposition of chemical species with the relevant rate.
The chemical species that are emitted into the model and the emission rates are read into the model using a namelist file.

Namelist files are also used to specify the initial conditions of chemical species and the mixing ratios of those chemical species that are fixed throughout the model.
In all simulations, methane (\ce{CH4}) was fixed to 1.75 ppmv while carbon monoxide (CO) and \ce{O3} are initialised at 200 ppbv and 40 ppbv and then allowed to evolve freely.

\section{Chemical Mechanisms} \label{s:chemical_mechanisms}
Chemical mechanisms describe the atmospheric chemistry used by a model.
The chemical mechanism specifies all reactions, products and rate constants of each chemical species.  
The number of species determines the size of the system of differential equations determined by Eq.~\eqref{e:conc} which determines the amount of computing resources required for the model simulations.

Chemical mechanisms range from highly-detailed (explicit) chemical mechanisms to the less-detailed lumped-structure and lumped-molecule chemical mechanisms.
Explicit chemical mechanisms, such as \citet{Aumont:2005}, include thousands of reactions outlining the degradation chemistry of VOCs even including reactions of minor importance in the atmosphere.
Near-explicit chemical mechanisms, such as the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) of \citet{Jenkin:1997}, \citet{Jenkin:2003}, \citet{Saunders:2003}, \citet{Bloss:2005} are less-detailed than explicit chemical mechanisms but still contain thousands of reactions and as such are mainly used in box models.
%The MCM representation of VOC degradation chemistry is discussed in more detail in Sect.~\ref{ss:near_explicit}.

Many other chemical mechanisms developed simplified approaches to describe atmospheric chemistry for use in regional and global models.
These reduced chemical mechanisms aggregate (or lump) VOC into mechanism species and the secondary degradation of these mechanism species attempts to replicate ambient measurements and chamber experiments \citep{Stockwell:2012}.
The first part of this study compares the maximal ozone produced from a number of reduced chemical mechanisms, listed in Table~\ref{t:mechanisms}, a description of the different reduction techniques used by the reduced mechanisms is found in Sect.~\ref{ss:lumped_intermediate}, Sect.~\ref{ss:lumped_molecule} and Sect.~\ref{ss:lumped_structure}.
The main results from the chemical mechanism comparison study are presented in Sect.~\ref{s:chemical_mechanism_results}.

\subsection{Near-Explicit Chemical Mechanisms} \label{ss:near_explicit}
The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM~v3) is a near-explicit mechanism describing the chemical degradation of 107 non-aromatic VOCs in \citep{Saunders:2003} and 18 aromatic VOCs in \citep{Jenkin:2003}. 
The MCM~v3.2 was the reference mechanism throughout this study as it was the most recent version of the MCM at the time of the first experiments related to the chemical mechanism study; the MCM~v3.2 was obtained from the world wide web (\mbox{\url{http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCMv3.2/}}).
In total, the MCM~v3.2 has $12,691$ reactions including $4351$ organic compounds and $46$ inorganic compounds. 
%The primary VOCs represented by the MCM~v3.2 were determined by which VOC have the most emissions (by mass) as listed by the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and makes up about 70\% of the mass emissions of unique species achieved.

Rate constants and branching ratios of the reactions represented in the MCM~v3.2 are those recommended by IUPAC.
If no data was available then they are estimated using structure activity representation (SAR) or group reactivity (GR) methods.
Each primary VOC and each degradation product, is individually degraded until it is broken down to \ce{CO2}, \ce{H2O}, CO or an organic product (or radical) already represented by the MCM \citep{Jenkin:1997}. 
In order to minimize the number of reactions and species in the MCM~v3, reactions with low probability and those reactions deemed of minor importance are not included.
Also the reactions between peroxy radicals are represented by a single parameterised reaction which greatly reduces the number of reactions.

\subsection{Lumped Intermediate Chemical Mechanisms} \label{ss:lumped_intermediate}
Lumped intermediate chemical mechanisms aggregate the degradation products rather than primary VOC.
The Common Representative Intermediates (CRI) chemical mechanism \citep{Jenkin:2008} is an example of a lumped intermediate mechanism.

The CRI is a reduced version of the MCM developed for 3-D models.
Reducing the complexity of the MCM was achieved by representing many degradation products (intermediates) in the CRI by a single mechanism species designed to produce the same amount of ozone as when using the MCM.
The CRI~v2 was used in this study and the intermediates in this version of the CRI mirror the ozone production from the MCM~v3.1.

The CRI~v2 is available online (\mbox{\url{http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/CRI}}) in a full version and further reduced variants that include even further reductions to the chemistry represented in MCM~v3.1 by also lumping VOCs into lumped mechanism species.
\citet{Jenkin:2008} describes the main assumptions made in order to condense the organic chemistry of the MCM~v3.1 to the lumped intermediate chemistry of the CRI~v2, while \citet{Watson:2008} describes the further reductions made to the CRI~v2 to produce the five lumped emission variants.
The most reduced version of the CRI~v2 has also been implemented into the widely used 3-D regional model WRF-CHEM \citep{Archer-Nicholls:2014}.

\subsection{Lumped Molecule Chemical Mechanisms} \label{ss:lumped_molecule}
Lumped molecule chemical mechanisms aggregate primary VOC into mechanism species and is the most simplification common technique.
However, lumped-molecule chemical mechanisms use different approaches in creating these lumped species.
Typically VOCs having large emissions, such as methane, isoprene, ethane and ethene, are represented by dedicated species with mechanism species used to represent all other VOCs.
These lumped mechanism species typically represent NMVOC based on functional group, OH-reactivity or a combination of both.
Table~\ref{t:mechanisms} lists the lumped-molecule chemical mechanisms used in this thesis and implemented into the MECCA model.

\subsubsection{MOZART}
The Model for OZone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART) chemical mechanism is an example of a lumped molecule chemical mechanism used in global and regional 3-D models.
MOZART was developed for global chemical transport models and describes chemical processes within the planetary boundary layer, free troposphere and stratosphere.
MOZART-4 \citep{Emmons:2010} was used in this study.

MOZART-4 represents methane, ethane, propane, ethene, propene, isoprene and formaldehyde by explicit species.
The lumped mechanism species, BIGALK, BIGENE and TOLUENE, are used to represent alkanes and alkenes with four or more carbon atoms and all aromatic VOC \citep{Emmons:2010}.
Thus, the lumping species used by MOZART are based on the functionality of the VOC.
There are no mechanism species representing emissions of esters, ethers or chlorinated NMVOC, when representing emissions of these less-reactive NMVOC are added to the BIGALK mechanism species as this has the lowest OH-reactivity.

\todo[inline]{modifications for use in MECCA}

\subsubsection{RADM2}
The Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) \citep{Stockwell:1990} is used in regional modelling studies.
RADM2 is still popular within the modelling community as outlined by the review of European modelling groups by \citet{Baklanov:2014}.

Methane, ethane, ethene, isoprene and formaldehyde are represented explicitly in RAMD2.
RADM2 represents other VOC using lumped species based on the OH-reactivity and functional group of the VOC.
The lumped mechanism species, HC3, HC5, and HC8, represent alkanes and other VOCs such as alcohols, ethers and  chlorinated VOC based on their OH-reactivity.
Alkenes are represented by OLT or OLI depending on the position of the double bond (OLT: terminal alkenes and OLI: internal alkenes).

Aromatic VOC are represented by TOL or XYL depending on OH-reactivity and CSL is used for hydroxy-substituted aromatics.
Carbonyls and organic acids are also represented by lumped mechanism species.
Typically the NMVOC having the least number of carbons (e.g. formaldehyde and formic acid) is represented by an explicit species and then all other species from that functional group are represented by a lumped species.

\subsubsection{RACM}
\citet{Stockwell:1997} describes Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) which updates RADM2.
RACM includes further lumped mechanism species such as API and LIM to represent cyclic terpenes with one double bond and all other cyclic terpenes.

\subsubsection{RACM2}
RACM was further extended and updated to RACM2 \citep{Goliff:2013} including more lumped mechanism species to represent primary VOC emissions as well as updating the secondary chemistry of lumped mechanism species.
The biggest changes in the chemistry was to the representation of aromatic chemistry.
RACM2 now represents aromatic VOC using eight mechanism species instead of three species as in RACM, with explicit representation of benzene and each xylene isomer having its own mechanism species.
The secondary chemistry of the aromatic VOC was updated to reflect the MCM.

Acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) are now treated as separate species rather than being represent as a single mechanism species, KET, in RADM2 and RACM.
Alcohols are also represented in RACM2, whereas in the previous versions, alcohols were represented by HC3, HC5 or HC8.
\todo[inline]{isoprene degradation products from RADM2->RACM->RACM2}

\subsection{Lumped Structure Chemical Mechanisms} \label{ss:lumped_structure}
Lumped-structure chemical mechanisms express VOCs as permutations of building blocks representing the structure of the emitted VOC.
The Carbon Bond mechanism is the most widely used lumped-structure chemical mechanism which includes mechanism species representing the different carbon bonds present in emitted VOC.

\subsubsection{CBM-IV}
The fourth version of the Carbon Bond mechanism was developed to represent the chemistry in polluted urban conditions and described in \citet{Gery:1989}.
CBM-IV represents $20$ organic species and requires $46$ reactions to fully represent the secondary chemistry.
Explicitly represented emitted NMVOC are those with the most significant emissions: isoprene, ethene and formaldehyde.
Mechanism species represent the \ce{C-C} bond (PAR), OLE represents \ce{C=C} and ALD2 represents \ce{C=O} and less and more reactive aromatic VOC are represented by TOL and XYL. 

NMVOC emissions emitted by the mechanism species are described in \citet{Hogo:1989}.
For example, if heptane, having seven carbons each with a single bond, has emissions of $1 \times 10^9$~molecules~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ then using the CBM-IV, these emissions would be represented by $7$~PAR and thus PAR emissions would be $7 \times 10^9$~molecules~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$.
Also, propene is represented as $1$~OLE and $1$~PAR and so emissions of $1 \times 10^9$~molecules~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$  would be emitted as $1 \times 10^9$~molecules~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ of OLE and $1 \times 10^9$~molecules~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ of PAR.

\subsubsection{CB05}
CBM-IV was updated to CB05 \citep{Yarwood:2005} to include more species representing emitted VOC.
CB05 includes $99$ organic reactions to represent the degradation of $37$ organic species.
Mechanism species for terpenes (TERP), ethane (ETHA), aldehydes with more than three carbons (ALDX), methanol (MEOH), ethanol (ETOH) and alkenes with both internal (IOLE) and external (OLE) double bonds were included.  
CB05 was also updated to include low-\ce{NO_x} chemistry including peroxide formation.

\section{Using the Chemical Mechanisms in MECCA}
As outlined in Sect.~\ref{ss:model_setup}, the MECCA boxmodel is based upon the KPP pre-processor and so required that all chemical mechanisms listed in Table~\ref{t:mechanisms} be written in the KPP format.
The KPP format of each chemical mechanism was either obtained from the WRF/Chem \citep{Grell:2005} \todo{update citation} model, which includes KPP files of RADM2, RACM and CBM-IV for use within the model.
For all the other chemical mechanisms, the chemistry published in the original reference were adapted to the KPP format.

Some changes were made to the original chemistry specified by each chemical mechanism.
Firstly, the inorganic chemistry of the MCM~v3.2 was used in each chemical mechanism in order to focus on differences between chemical mechanisms of their representation of the secondary degradation chemistry of emitted NMVOC.
Other changes included adopting the MCM~v3.2 approaches to photolysis and peroxy-peroxy reactions, a more detailed description of these changes are found in the supplementary material of the first paper of this thesis (Chap.~\ref{c:paper_1}). \todo{Include supplementary material}
