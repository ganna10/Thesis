\noindent
Contribution to Paper I:

The experimental setup was designed by Tim Butler, the tagging of all chemical mechanisms and all model simulations performed by myself at the IASS.
All analysis and graphical plotting of the model output data was performed by myself.
The paper was written by myself assisted by Tim Butler.

\noindent
Contribution to Paper II:

The experimental setup was formulated by Erika von Schneidemesser, Tim Butler and myself.
Translating the NMVOC emissions into chemical mechanism species was performed by myself aided by Erika von Schneidemesser and colleagues at TNO.
All model simulations and analysis of model data was performed by myself at the IASS.
I prepared an initial draft of the paper which was further updated by Erika von Schneidemesser and the other co-authors.

\noindent
Contribution to Paper III:

The experimental setup was designed by Tim Butler any myself.
I updated the box model setup to include vertical mixing and a diurnal PBL height, and performed all model simulations at the IASS.
Observational data was provided by Noelia Otero Felipe and WRF-Chem model output by Kathleen A. Mar and Narendra Ojha.
Analysis and graphical plotting of the box model output data was performed by myself.
The paper was written by myself aided by the co-authors.
