    abstract = "An analytic formula is derived expressing the tropospheric O3 production rate, P(O3), as a power law function of radical production rate, NOx concentration, and VOC–OH reactivity. Power law exponents depend on a single parameter, L N / Q , which is the fraction of free radicals removed by reactions with NOx. The formula reproduces the functional form of P(O3) obtained from photochemical box model calculations. Ozone production rates are shown to have a smooth transition between previously derived low and high NOx limits. Potential applications of this formula include analysis of day to day and place to place variations in P(O3), with P(O3) either obtained from measurements collected during field campaigns or produced as output from chemical-transport models.

    abstract = "Calculation of the ozone production potential of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) has traditionally been performed using so-called incremental reactivity techniques, requiring multiple photochemical model runs in which the combined direct and indirect effects on ozone from slight perturbations to each VOC are investigated in turn. A new approach to this problem is presented here using an extensively tagged chemical mechanism, in which the direct effects of VOC on ozone are calculated using a single model run. The results of this approach are consistent with previous work, but deliver much more detailed information about the VOC intermediate oxidation products involved in the production of ozone. We show that different classes of VOC exhibit very different temporal evolution in their ozone production potential, with alkenes and reactive aromatic VOC producing ozone rapidly, while the ozone production potential of alkanes increases in the day after they are emitted. We suggest that this is related to the rate at which these different classes of compounds are able to produce very small oxidation fragments. This multi-day ozone production potential has implications for emission control strategies for the management of air quality in polluted regions. We also relate the ozone production potential of VOC to the OH reactivity of the VOC oxidation intermediates, and show that the early oxidation products of alkenes and reactive aromatics are more efficient at producing ozone in their subsequent reactions with OH than similarly reactive alkanes. While this study examines idealised chemical conditions in a box model, the techniques employed here could potentially be adapted to the study of a wider range of atmospheric conditions using three-dimensional air quality models.

The schemes constructed using this protocol are applicable, however, to a wide range of ambient conditions, and may be employed in models of urban, rural or remote tropospheric environments, or for the simulation of secondary pollutant formation for a range of NOx or VOC emission scenarios. These schemes are believed to be particularly appropriate for comparative assessments of the formation of oxidants, such as ozone, from the degradation of organic compounds. The protocol is divided into a series of subsections dealing with initiation reactions, the reactions of the radical intermediates and the further degradation of first and subsequent generation products. The present work draws heavily on previous reviews and evaluations of data relevant to tropospheric chemistry. Where necessary, however, existing recommendations are adapted, or new rules are defined, to reflect recent improvements in the database, particularly with regard to the treatment of peroxy radical (RO2) reactions for which there have been major advances, even since comparatively recent reviews. The present protocol aims to take into consideration work available in the open literature up to the end of 1994, and some further studies known by the authors, which were under review at that time. A major disadvantage of explicit chemical mechanisms is the very large number of reactions potentially generated, if a series of rules is rigorously applied. The protocol aims to limit the number of reactions in a degradation scheme by applying a degree of strategic simplification, whilst maintaining the essential features of the chemistry. These simplification measures are described, and their influence is demonstrated and discussed. The resultant mechanisms are believed to provide a suitable starting point for the generation of reduced chemical mechanisms. "

The mechanism is intended to be valid for remote to polluted conditions and from the Earth's surface through the upper troposphere. The RACM mechanism is based upon the earlier Regional Acid Deposition Model, version 2 (RADM2) mechanism and the more detailed Euro-RADM mechanism. The RACM mechanism includes rate constants and product yields from the most recent laboratory measurements, and it has been tested against environmental chamber data. A new condensed reaction mechanism is included for biogenic compounds: isoprene, alpha-pinene, and d-limonene. The branching ratios for alkane decay were reevaluated, and in the revised mechanism the aldehyde to ketone ratios were significantly reduced. The relatively large amounts of nitrates resulting from the reactions of unbranched alkenes with NO3 are now included, and the production of HO from the ozonolysis of alkenes has a much greater yield. The aromatic chemistry has been revised through the use of new laboratory data. The yield of cresol production from aromatics was reduced, while the reactions of HO, NO3, and O3 with unsaturated dicarbonyl species and unsaturated peroxynitrate are now included in the RACM mechanism. The peroxyacetyl nitrate chemistry and the organic peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions were revised, and organic peroxy radical +NO3 reactions were added.},

The rate constants and reactions have been updated based on current data and evaluations, the aromatics mechanisms have been reformulated and are less parameterized, chlorine chemistry has been added, the method used to represent peroxy reactions has been reformulated to be more appropriate for modeling gas-phase secondary organic aerosol precursors, and representations for many types of VOCs have been added or improved. This mechanism was evaluated against the result of 2400 environmental chamber experiments carried out in 11 different environmental chambers, including experiments to test mechanisms for over 110 types of VOCs. The performance in simulating the chamber data was generally satisfactory for most types of VOCs but some biases were seen in simulations of some types of experiments. The mechanism was used to derive updated MIR and other ozone reactivity scales for almost 1100 types of VOCs, though in most cases the changes in MIR values relative to SAPRC-99 were not large. This mechanism update results in somewhat lower predictions of ozone in one-day ambient model scenarios under low VOC/NO. x conditions.

Although the cumulative importance of these organic intermediates is widely acknowledged, there is still a critical lack of information concerning the detailed composition of the highly functionalized secondary organics in the gas and condensed phases. The evaluation of their impacts on pollution episodes, climate, and the tropospheric oxidizing capacity requires modelling tools that track the identity and reactivity of organic carbon in the various phases down to the ultimate oxidation products, CO and CO2. However, a fully detailed representation of the atmospheric transformations of organic compounds involves a very large number of intermediate species, far in excess of the number that can be reasonably written manually. This paper describes (1) the development of a data processing tool to generate the explicit gas-phase oxidation schemes of acyclic hydrocarbons and their oxidation products under tropospheric conditions and (2) the protocol used to select the reaction products and the rate constants. Results are presented using the fully explicit oxidation schemes generated for two test species: n-heptane and isoprene. Comparisons with well-established mechanisms were performed to evaluate these generated schemes. Some preliminary results describing the gradual change of organic carbon during the oxidation of a given parent compound are presented.",

This article presents a review of insights derived from photochemical models and field measurements. The ozone–precursor relationship can be understood in terms of a fundamental split into a NOx-senstive and VOC-sensitive (or NOx-saturated) chemical regimes. These regimes are associated with the chemistry of odd hydrogen radicals and appear in different forms in studies of urbanized regions, power plant plumes and the remote troposphere. Factors that affect the split into NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry include: VOC/NOx ratios, VOC reactivity, biogenic hydrocarbons, photochemical aging, and rates of meteorological dispersion. Analyses of ozone–NOx–VOC sensitivity from 3D photochemical models show a consistent pattern, but predictions for the impact of reduced NOx and VOC in indivdual locations are often very uncertain. This uncertainty can be identified by comparing predictions from different model scenarios that reflect uncertainties in meteorology, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Several observation-based approaches have been proposed that seek to evaluate ozone–NOx–VOC sensitivity directly from ambient measurements (including ambient VOC, reactive nitrogen, and peroxides). Observation-based approaches have also been used to evaluate emission rates, ozone production efficiency, and removal rates of chemically active species. Use of these methods in combination with models can significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with model predictions. "

The identification of these contributions is important, e.g. for the assessment of emissions from traffic. The non-linear character of ozone chemistry complicates the online diagnosis during multi-decadal chemistry-climate simulations. A methodology is suggested, which is efficient enough to be incorporated in multi-decadal simulations. Eight types of NOx emissions are included in the model. For each a NOy (=all N components, except N2 and N2O) tracer and an ozone tracer is included in the model, which experience the same emissions and loss processes like the online chemistry fields. To calculate the ozone changes caused by an individual NOx emission, the assumption is made that the NOx relative contributions from various sources are identical to the NOy relative contributions. To evaluate this method each NOx emission has been increased by 5\% and a detailed error analysis is given. In the regions of the main impact of individual sources the potential error of the calculated contribution is significantly smaller than the contribution. Moreover, the changes caused by an increase of the emissions of 5\% were detected with a higher accuracy than the potential error of the absolute contribution.",

    abstract = {We have applied a global three-dimensional chemistry-transport model to quantify the photochemistry of tropospheric O3 and compare the main source categories. We simulated a 15 year period (1979–1993) on the basis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts meteorological reanalyses and a time-varying emission data set. We calculate that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) strongly contributes to O3 in regions where the photochemistry is quiescent. Since such regions play a minor role in radiative and chemical processes, we argue that STE-derived O3 is much less important than is suggested by its column abundance. By distinguishing between photochemical pathways in the model we calculate that tropospheric O3 in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is strongly affected by industrial and fossil fuel-related emissions. In the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, natural emissions still play a major role. Our model results indicate a less important role for man-made biomass burning emissions than previous analyses. Further, the results show that tropospheric O3 trends are strongly influenced by transports of pollution and by meteorological variability. Scenario calculations for the year 2025 suggest that man-made emissions at low northern latitudes, in particular in southern and eastern Asia, will become a very strong tropospheric O3 source in the next decades. This will influence O3 levels on a hemispheric scale so that despite pollution regulations in Europe and North America, surface O3 will continue to grow.},

Within chemistry-climate and transport models this chemistry is simplified for computational expediency. We compare the state of the art Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) with six tropospheric chemistry schemes (CRI-reduced, GEOS-CHEM and a GEOS-CHEM adduct, MOZART-2, TOMCAT and CBM-IV) that could be used within composition transport models. We test the schemes within a box model framework under conditions derived from a composition transport model and from field observations from a regional scale pollution event. We find that CRI-reduced provides much skill in simulating the full chemistry, yet with greatly reduced complexity. We find significant variations between the other chemical schemes, and reach the following conclusions. 1) The inclusion of a gas phase N2O5+H2O reaction in one scheme and not others is a large source of uncertainty in the inorganic chemistry. 2) There are significant variations in the calculated concentration of PAN between the schemes, which will affect the long range transport of reactive nitrogen in global models. 3) The representation of isoprene chemistry differs hugely between the schemes, leading to significant uncertainties on the impact of isoprene on composition. 4) Differences are found in NO3 concentrations in the nighttime chemistry. Resolving these four issues through further investigative laboratory studies will reduce the uncertainties within the chemical schemes of global tropospheric models."

    abstract = { This paper discusses methods for ranking photochemical ozone formation reactivities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Photochemical mechanisms for the atmospheric reactions of 118 VOCs were used to calculate their effects on ozone formation under various NOx conditions in model scenarios representing 39 different urban areas. Their effects on ozone were used to derive 18 different ozone reactivity scales, one of which is the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) scale used in the new California Low Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuel Regulations. These scales are based on three different methods for quantifying ozone impacts and on six different approaches for dealing with the dependencies of reactivity on NOx. The predictions of the scales are compared, the reasons for their similarities and differences are discussed, and the sensitivities of the scales to NOx and other scenario conditions are examined. Scales based on peak ozone levels were highly dependent on NOx, but those based on integrated ozone were less sensitive to NOx and tended to be similar to the MIR scale. It is concluded that the MIR scale or one based on integrated ozone is appropriate for applications requiring use of a single reactivity scale. }

    abstract = "Photochemical air quality models play a central role in both schentific investigation of how pollutants evlove in the atmosphere as well as developing policies to manage air quality. In the past 30 years, these models have evolved from rather crude representations of the physics and chemistry impacting trace species to their current state: comprehensive, but not complete. The evolution has included advancements in not only the level of process descriptions, but also the computational implementation, including numerical methods. As part of the NARSTO Critical Reviews, this article discusses the current strengths and weaknesses of air quality models and the modeling process. Current Eulerian models are found to represent well the primary processes impacting the evolution of trace species in most cases though some exceptions may exist. For example, sub-grid-scale processes, such as concentrated power plant plumes, are treated only approximately. It is not apparent how much such approximations affect their results and the polices based upon those results. A significant weakness has been in how investigators have addressed, and communicated, such uncertainties. Studies find that major uncertainties are due to model inputs, e.g., emissions and meteorology, more so than the model itself. One of the primary weakness identified is in the modeling process, not the models. Evaluation has been limited both due to data constraints. Seldom is there ample observational data to conduct a detailed model intercomparison using consistent data (e.g., the same emissions and meteorology). Further model advancement, and development of greater confidence in the use of models, is hampered by the lack of thorough evaluation and intercomparisons. Model advances are seen in the use of new tools for extending the interpretation of model results, e.g., process and sensitivity analysis, modeling systems to facilitate their use, and extension of model capabilities, e.g., aerosol dynamics capabilities and sub-grid-scale representations. Another possible direction that is the development and widespread use of a community model acting as a platform for multiple groups and agencies to collaborate and progress more rapidly. "

    abstract = "A reduced mechanism describing ozone formation from the tropospheric degradation of methane and 115 emitted non-methane hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds has been developed, using the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3.1 (MCM v3.1) as a reference benchmark. The Common Representative Intermediates mechanism version 2 (CRI v2) has been built up on a compound-by-compound basis, with the performance of its chemistry optimised for each compound in turn by comparison with that of MCM v3.1, using a series of five-day box model simulations. The resultant mechanism contains 1183 reactions of 434 chemical species, i.e., ca. 10\% of the number of reactions and species to degrade the same set of VOCs in MCM v3.1. Similarly to CRI v1 (Jenkin et al., 2002a), a key assumption in the CRI v2 construction methodology is that the potential for ozone formation from a given volatile organic compound (VOC) is related to the number of reactive (i.e., CC and CH) bonds it contains. This index allows a series of generic intermediates to be defined, with each being used as a “common representative” for a large set of species possessing the same index, as formed in detailed mechanisms such as the MCM. The performance of CRI v2 is shown to compare well with that of MCM v3.1 for a wide range of ambient conditions, which consider variations in VOC/NOx emissions ratio over ranges of 32 and 400 for anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, respectively, in box model simulations; and in simulations of the TORCH 2003 campaign in the southern UK using a photochemical trajectory model, which considers notable ranges in the relative and absolute emissions of NOx and VOCs, and in the relative contributions of anthropogenic and biogenic species to the VOC total. CRI v2 is a reduced mechanism of intermediate complexity, which is traceable to MCM v3.1, and which provides the basis for further systematic reduction. Two companion papers consider further reduction of CRI v2 through emissions lumping and development and assessment of an associated SOA module. "

    abstract = "The Common Representative Intermediates mechanism version 2 (CRI v2) is a reduced mechanism of intermediate complexity, traceable to the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3.1 (MCM v3.1), which couples with a detailed speciation of 112 emitted anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Systematic lumping techniques for the emitted anthropogenic VOC species have been used to reduce CRI v2, creating a series of five reduced variants, the performances of which have been evaluated against that of CRI v2 for a range of ambient conditions. For the initial reduction phases, minor emitted VOCs accounting for increasing proportions of the VOC mass emissions total, up to 20\%, were redistributed into appropriate surrogates, and the redundant species and their associated chemistry were removed from the chemical mechanism. The surrogates were selected to maintain the chemical class of the redistributed VOCs within a number of VOC sub-categories, and aimed to preserve the ozone-forming ability of each category using the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) index as a criterion. This yielded three reduced mechanisms (CRI v2-R1, CRI v2-R2 and CRI v2-R3) and allowed respective reductions of up to 25\% and 32\% in the numbers of reactions and species, with no significant degradation in the overall performance of the mechanisms or in the relative contributions of the VOC sub-categories to ozone formation. More severe levels of reduction were also imposed, to limit the number of representative VOCs in each sub-catergory, with the choice of species taking account of their abundance in the detailed speciation, and the simplicity of the associated degradation mechanism. The POCP index was once again used as a guide to help optimise the overall ozone-forming ability of the VOC speciation. This yielded two further mechanisms (CRI v2-R4 and CRI v2-R5) with reductions of up to 53\% and 55\% in the numbers of reactions and species relative to CRI v2. These mechanisms display a degree of compromise in the ozone-forming ability of the VOC sub-categories, but retain a good level of overall performance. The most reduced variant (CRI v2-R5) uses 19 non-methane VOCs to represent the anthropogenic speciation, and is considered appropriate as a traceable reference mechanism for use in global chemistry-transport models.

    ABSTRACT = {Gas-phase chemical mechanisms are vital components of prognostic air quality models. The mechanisms are incorporated into modules that are used to calculate the chemical sources and sinks of ozone and the precursors of particulates. Fifty years ago essential atmospheric chemical processes, such as the importance of the hydroxyl radical, were unknown and crude air quality models incorporated only a few parameterized reactions obtained by fitting observations. Over the years, chemical mechanisms for air quality modeling improved and became more detailed as more experimental data and more powerful computers became available. However it will not be possible to incorporate a detailed treatment of the chemistry for all known chemical constituents because there are thousands of organic compounds emitted into the atmosphere. Some simplified method of treating atmospheric organic chemistry is required to make air quality modeling computationally possible. The majority of the significant differences between air quality mechanisms are due to the differing methods of treating this organic chemistry. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of atmospheric chemistry that is incorporated into air quality mechanisms and to suggest areas in which more research is needed.},

Recent laboratory measurements of the rate constants for peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions show that there are large differences between these rate constants. We present methods of estimating organic peroxy radical self-reaction rate constants from an empirical expression. These self-reaction rate constants may be used to estimate the rates of peroxy radical cross reactions. There are also new data available on the rate constants for peroxyacetyl nitrate formation, decomposition, the reaction of acetyl peroxy radicals and other organic peroxy radicals with NO, and the reactions of NO3 with organic peroxy radicals. To estimate the importance of these reactions, these new data along with revisions to the product yields for organic peroxy radical-organic peroxy radical reactions were implemented in the mechanism of Stockwell et al. [1990]. The revised mechanism yields significantly different concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate, higher organic hydroperoxides and peroxyacetic acid concentrations. Nighttime concentrations of organic peroxy radicals, HO2, HO, and NO3 are also strongly affected by organic peroxy radical-organic peroxy radical reactions and the reactions of organic peroxy radicals with NO3. Our results suggest that the reactions of organic peroxy radicals with NO3 are more important than organic peroxy radical-organic peroxy radical reactions in the nighttime atmosphere.},

    abstract = { Abstract Many large metropolitan areas experience elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone pollution during the summertime “smog season”. Local environmental or health agencies often need to make daily air pollution forecasts for public advisories and for input into decisions regarding abatement measures and air quality management. Such forecasts are usually based on statistical relationships between weather conditions and ambient air pollution concentrations. Multivariate linear regression models have been widely used for this purpose, and well-specified regressions can provide reasonable results. However, pollution-weather relationships are typically complex and nonlinear—especially for ozone—properties that might be better captured by neural networks. This study investigates the potential for using neural networks to forecast ozone pollution, as compared to traditional regression models. Multiple regression models and neural networks are examined for a range of cities under different climate and ozone regimes, enabling a comparative study of the two approaches. Model comparison statistics indicate that neural network techniques are somewhat (but not dramatically) better than regression models for daily ozone prediction, and that all types of models are sensitive to different weather-ozone regimes and the role of persistence in aiding predictions. }

The helium content of the air is found to be remarkably constant up to 20 km but the water content is found to fall very rapidly just above the tropopause, and in the lowest 1 km of the stratosphere the humidity mixing ratio falls through a ratio of 10—1.The helium distribution is not compatible with the view of a quiescent stratosphere free from turbulence or vertical motions. The water-vapour distribution is incompatible with a turbulent stratosphere unless some dynamic process maintains the dryness of the stratosphere. In view of the large wind shear which is normally found just above the tropopause it is unlikely that this region is free from turbulence.The observed distributions can be explained by the existence of a circulation in which air enters the stratosphere at the equator, where it is dried by condensation, travels in the stratosphere to temperate and polar regions, and sinks into the troposphere. The sinking, however, will warm the air unless it is being cooled by radiation and the idea of a stratosphere in radiative equilibrium must be abandoned. The cooling rate must lie between about 0.1 and 1.1°C per day but a value near 0.5°C per day seems most probable. At the equator the ascending air must be subject to heating by radiation.The circulation is quite reasonable on energy considerations. It is consistent with the existence of lower temperatures in the equatorial stratosphere than in polar and temperate regions, and if the flow can carry ozone from the equator to the poles then it gives a reasonable explanation of the high ozone values observed at high latitudes. The dynamic consequences of the circulation are not considered. It should however be noted that there is considerable difficulty to account for the smallness of the westerly winds in the stratosphere, as the rotation of the earth should convert the slow poleward movement into strong westerly winds.},

One dataset is from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis, the second dataset uses meteorology from the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3) forced with observed interannually varying sea surface temperatures. All emissions, except those from lightning are annually constant. Analysis of these simulations focuses on the period between 1979–1999, due to meteorological discontinuities in the NCEP reanalysis during the 1970s. The meteorology using CAM3 captures observed trends in temperature and water vapor; the simulation using NCEP meteorology does not. This paper examines the regional and global interannual variability of various chemical and meteorological fields: CO, OH, O3 and HNO3, the surface photolysis rate of NO2 (as a proxy for overhead cloudiness), lightning NO emissions, water vapor, planetary boundary layer height, and temperature. The variability due to changes in emissions is not considered in this analysis. In both the NCEP and CAM3 simulations the relative variability of CO, OH, O3 and HNO3 are qualitatively similar, with variability maxima both in the tropics and the high latitudes. Locally, relative variability generally ranges between 3 and 10\%; globally the tropospheric variability generally ranges from half to one percent, but can be higher. For most fields the leading global Empirical Orthogonal Function explains approximately 10\% of the variability and correlates significantly with El Niño. In both simulations the first principal component of a multiple tracer, globally averaged analysis shows a strong coupling between surface temperature, measures of the hydrological cycle, CO and OH, but is not correlated with El Niño. In both simulations we examine the global response of the selected variables to changes in global surface temperature, and compare with a climate simulation over the 21st century."

The changes in tropospheric ozone observed during the 1997–1998 El Niño are considered to have been caused by large-scale processes due to the shift in the tropical convection pattern associated with sea surface temperature (SST) changes and by large emissions of ozone precursors due to pronounced biomass burning in the Indonesian region (mainly in Sumatra and Borneo). This simulation study is focused on the effects of meteorological changes caused by the El Niño, aside from the effects of the Indonesian biomass burning. Our simulation results show that about half of the ozone increase observed over the equatorial western Pacific and Indonesia (6–12 Dobson units in tropospheric column ozone) can be explained by the meteorological effects of the El Niño with the remainder attributed to the Indonesian biomass burning, whereas the ozone decrease over the eastern Pacific (4–8 Dobson units) can be attributed to the meteorological effects alone. Moreover, our study suggests that a change in photochemical processes (e.g., water vapor concentration controlling the lifetimes of ozone and other related species, and wet scavenging associated with convective precipitation) also plays an important role in the tropical ozone distribution during the course of the 1997–1998 El Niño event.},

This paper presents a comprehensive numerical comparison between five dedicated explicit and four implicit solvers for a set of seven benchmark problems from actual applications. The implicit solvers use sparse matrix techniques to economize on the numerical linear algebra overhead. As a result they are often more efficient than the dedicated explicit ones, particularly when approximately two or more figures of accuracy are required. In most test cases, sparse RODAs, a Rosenbrock solver, came out as most competitive in the 1\% error region. Of the dedicated explicit solvers, TWOSTEP came out as best. When less than 1\% accuracy is aimed at, this solver performs very efficiently for tropospheric gas-phase problems. However, like all other dedicated explicit solvers, it cannot efficiently deal with gas-liquid phase chemistry. The results presented may constitute a guide for atmospheric modelers to select a suitable integrator based on the type and dimension of their chemical mechanism and on the desired level of accuracy.

In terms of ozone production in PLUME1, the most productive mechanisms are EMEP and IVL, the RADM-type mechanisms lie in the mid-range and the CBM-1V type mechanisms fall at the bottom of the range. The differences in H2O2 can partly be explained by an incorrect use of the HO2 + HO2 rate constant and by differences in the treatment of the peroxy radical interactions. In the PLUME1 case the r.m.s. error of the PAN tendency was found to be 29\%. Differences between mechanisms for the HO radical are 10, 15 and 19\% and for the NO3 radical 35, 16 and 40\% (for LAND, FREE, PLUME1) in terms of the r.m.s. error of the results for a 12 h time period centred around the last noon (HO), respectively, a 8 h time period centred around the last midnight (NO3) of simulation.

Large differences between mechanisms are observed for higher organic peroxides and higher aldehydes with a r.m.s. error of around 50\% for the final concentration in PLUME1.

The second generation Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) gas phase chemical mechanism, like its predecessor RADM1, is highly nonlinear, since predicted ozone, sulfate, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations are complicated functions of NOx and nonmethane hydrocarbon concentrations. The RADM2 chemical mechanism is an upgrade of RADM1 in that (1) three classes of higher alkanes are used instead of one, (2) a more detailed treatment of aromatic chemistry is used, (3) the two higher alkene classes now represent internal and terminal alkenes, (4) ketones and dicarbonyl species are treated as classes distinct from aldehydes, (5) isoprene is now included as an explicit species, and (6) there is a more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions. As a result of these improvements the RADM2 mechanism simulates the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate, HNO3, and H2O2 under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Comparisons of RADM2 mechanism with the RADM1 mechanism predictions and selected environmental chamber experimental results indicate that for typical atmospheric conditions, both mechanisms reliably predict O3, sulfate and nitric acid concentrations. The RADM2 mechanism gives lower and presumably more realistic predictions of H2O2 because of its more detailed treatment of peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions.},

The indicator species correlations are based on a series of photochemical simulations with varying rates of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and meteorology. Hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in models is shown to be linked to afternoon NOy > 20 ppb, O3/(NOy - NOx) < 7, HCHO/NOy < 0.28, and H2O2/HNO3 < 0.4. Lower NOy and higher ratios correspond with NOx-sensitive ozone. The correlation between NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator species remains, even when model emission rates and hydrocarbon/NOx ratios are changed by a factor of 2. Methods are developed for evaluating the goodness of fit between model NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator values. Ozone chemistry is also analyzed in terms of fundamental properties of odd hydrogen, and theoretical criteria for the transition between NOx- and hydrocarbon-sensitive regimes are derived. A theoretical correlation between O3 and H2O2 + NOy - NOx is developed as a way to extend rural O3-NOy correlations into urban locations. Measured indicator values during pollution events in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and rural Virginia are used to illustrate the range of observed values under different environmental conditions.},

    abstract = "Measurements of ozone throughout the troposphere clearly show an annual cycle. Over the last couple of decades it has become apparent that the measured annual cycle of ozone in certain locations shows a distinct maximum during spring and the magnitude of the maximum seems to have increased. There has been much debate as to the origins of this phenomenon. There is broad agreement that much of the ozone found in the troposphere is of photochemical origin. In contrast, there is still no over-arching consensus as to the mechanisms that lead to the formation of the spring ozone maximum. Part of the problem would seem to lie in the interpretation of measurements and the interactions of processes occurring on differing scales from the local to the global scale. This paper reviews both the experimental evidence concerning the origin of the spring ozone maximum and the supporting modelling studies. The roles of stratospheric–tropospheric exchange and photochemistry in the appearance of the spring ozone maximum are discussed; the evidence for various mechanisms for accumulation of ozone and its precursors are considered. The paper concludes with a summary of the state of the knowledge with respect to the spring ozone maximum and some possible areas for future consideration. The spring ozone phenomenon may well be a proxy for the continuing changes to the atmospheric composition owing to man's activities. Understanding the appearance of the spring ozone maximum and the mechanisms that lead to its formation therefore remains an issue fundamental to tropospheric chemistry. "

    abstract = "We have developed a global three-dimensional chemical transport model called Model of Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART), version 2. This model, which will be made available to the community, is built on the framework of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH) and can easily be driven with various meteorological inputs and model resolutions. In this work, we describe the standard configuration of the model, in which the model is driven by meteorological inputs every 3 hours from the middle atmosphere version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (MACCM3) and uses a 20-min time step and a horizontal resolution of 2.8 latitude × 2.8 longitude with 34 vertical levels extending up to approximately 40 km. The model includes a detailed chemistry scheme for tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbon chemistry, with 63 chemical species. Tracer advection is performed using a flux-form semi-Lagrangian scheme with a pressure fixer. Subgrid-scale convective and boundary layer parameterizations are included in the model. Surface emissions include sources from fossil fuel combustion, biofuel and biomass burning, biogenic and soil emissions, and oceanic emissions. Parameterizations of dry and wet deposition are included. Stratospheric concentrations of several long-lived species (including ozone) are constrained by relaxation toward climatological values. The distribution of tropospheric ozone is well simulated in the model, including seasonality and horizontal and vertical gradients. However, the model tends to overestimate ozone near the tropopause at high northern latitudes. Concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitric acid (HNO3) agree well with observed values, but peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) is overestimated by the model in the upper troposphere at several locations. Carbon monoxide (CO) is simulated well at most locations, but the seasonal cycle is underestimated at some sites in the Northern Hemisphere. We find that in situ photochemical production and loss dominate the tropospheric ozone budget, over input from the stratosphere and dry deposition. Approximately 75\% of the tropospheric production and loss of ozone occurs within the tropics, with large net production in the tropical upper troposphere. Tropospheric production and loss of ozone are three to four times greater in the northern extratropics than the southern extratropics. The global sources of CO consist of photochemical production (55\%) and direct emissions (45\%). The tropics dominate the chemistry of CO, accounting for about 75\% of the tropospheric production and loss. The global budgets of tropospheric ozone and CO are generally consistent with the range found in recent studies. The lifetime of methane (9.5 years) and methylchloroform (5.7 years) versus oxidation by tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH), two useful measures of the global abundance of OH, agree well with recent estimates. Concentrations of nonmethane hydrocarbons and oxygenated intermediates (carbonyls and peroxides) generally agree well with observations."

Comparison of modelled concentrations of ozone and a number of other species (NOx and selected hydrocarbons and organic oxygenates) was carried out, using data from three connected sites on two case study days when well-defined sea breeze conditions were established. The ozone concentrations obtained through the application of the PTM are a good approximation to the measured values, the average difference being ca. 15\%, indicating that the model was acceptable for evaluation of the details of the chemical processing. The detailed chemistry is examined, allowing conclusions to be drawn concerning chemical interferences in the measurements of NO2, and in relation to the sensitivity of ozone formation to changes in ambient temperature. Three important, and comparable, contributions to the temperature sensitivity are identified and quantified, namely (i) an effect of increasing biogenic emissions with temperature; (ii) an effect of increasing ambient water vapour concentration with temperature, and its influence on radical production; and (iii) an increase in VOC oxidation chain lengths resulting from the temperature-dependence of the kinetic parameters, particularly in relation to the stability of PAN and its higher analogues. The sensitivity of the simulations to the refinements implemented into MCM v3.1 are also presented and discussed. "

    abstract = "The impact of the megacities of the world on global tropospheric ozone, and conversely, the extent to which megacities are influenced by emissions of ozone precursors from outside of the megacities is examined under the four alternative RCP ('Representative Concentration Pathway') emissions scenarios. Despite accounting for about 6\% of present-day anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursor species, the contribution of emissions from megacities to global tropospheric ozone is calculated to be 0.84\%. By 2100 this contribution falls to between 0.18\% and 0.62\% depending on the scenario, with the lower value being for the most-polluting of the four future emissions scenarios due to stringent controls on ozone precursor emissions from highly populated areas combined with a stronger tropospheric background ozone field. The higher end of this range is from the least-polluting of the four emissions scenarios, due to lower background tropospheric ozone combined with the use of a simpler downscaling methodology in the construction of the scenario, which results in higher emissions from megacities. Although the absolute impact of megacities on global ozone is small, an important result of this study is that under all future scenarios, future air quality in megacities is expected to be less influenced by local emissions within the cities, but instead more influenced by emission sources outside of the cities, with mixing ratios of background ozone projected to play an increasing role in megacity air quality throughout the 21st century. Assumptions made when downscaling the emissions scenarios onto the grids used in such modelling studies can have a large influence on these results; future generations of emissions scenarios should include spatially explicit representations or urban development suitable for air quality studies using global chemical transport models."

    abstract = "A procedure for tagging ozone produced from NO sources through updates to an existing chemical mechanism is described, and results from its implementation in the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART-4), a global chemical transport model, are presented. Artificial tracers are added to the mechanism, thus, not affecting the standard chemistry. The results are linear in the troposphere, i.e., the sum of ozone from individual tagged sources equals the ozone from all sources to within 3\% in zonal mean monthly averages. In addition, the tagged ozone is shown to equal the standard ozone, when all tropospheric sources are tagged and stratospheric input is turned off. The stratospheric ozone contribution to the troposphere determined from the difference between total ozone and ozone from all tagged sources is significantly less than estimates using a traditional stratospheric ozone tracer (8 vs. 20 ppbv at the surface). The commonly used technique of perturbing NO emissions by 20\% in a region to determine its ozone contribution is compared to the tagging technique, showing that the tagged ozone is 2–4 times the ozone contribution that was deduced from perturbing emissions. The ozone tagging described here is useful for identifying source contributions based on NO emissions in a given state of the atmosphere, such as for quantifying the ozone budget."

abstract = "The impact of climate change on surface ozone over Europe was studied using four offline regional chemistry transport models (CTMs) and one online regional integrated climate-chemistry model (CCM), driven by the same global projection of future climate under the SRES A1B scenario. Anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors from RCP4.5 for year 2000 were used for simulations of both present and future periods in order to isolate the impact of climate change and to assess the robustness of the results across the different models. The sensitivity of the simulated surface ozone to changes in climate between the periods 2000–2009 and 2040–2049 differs by a factor of two between the models, but the general pattern of change with an increase in southern Europe is similar across different models. Emissions of isoprene differ substantially between different CTMs ranging from 1.6 to 8.0 Tg yr−1 for the current climate, partly due to differences in horizontal resolution of meteorological input data. Also the simulated change in total isoprene emissions varies substantially across models explaining part of the different climate response on surface ozone. Ensemble mean changes in summer mean ozone and mean of daily maximum ozone are close to 1 ppb(v) in parts of the land area in southern Europe. Corresponding changes of 95-percentiles of hourly ozone are close to 2 ppb(v) in the same region. In northern Europe ensemble mean for mean and daily maximum show negative changes while there are no negative changes for the higher percentiles indicating that climate impacts on O3 could be especially important in connection with extreme summer events."

    abstract = "The Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) is a gas-phase chemical mechanism that is widely used for the modeling of regional atmospheric chemistry. Much new data has been published since the original RACM was completed (Stockwell et al., 1997). The RACM mechanism was updated to create the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism, version 2 (RACM2). Like the RACM1 mechanism, the RACM2 mechanism is designed to simulate remote to polluted conditions from the Earth's surface through the upper troposphere. The RACM2 mechanism includes updated reaction schemes, rate constants and product yields. It has been tested against environmental chamber data and compared with previous RACM scenario simulations. The aromatic chemistry was expanded to include a greater number of species with highly revised reaction schemes. The reaction mechanism for isoprene was expanded to include a more explicit treatment of methyl vinyl ketone. Alcohols were speciated to more accurately reflect peroxy–peroxy reactions in the remote atmosphere. Acetone was speciated due to its importance in the upper troposphere. "

    abstract = "Ozone (O3) from 17 atmospheric chemistry models taking part in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) has been used to calculate tropospheric ozone radiative forcings (RFs). All models applied a common set of anthropogenic emissions, which are better constrained for the present-day than the past. Future anthropogenic emissions follow the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which define a relatively narrow range of possible air pollution emissions. We calculate a value for the pre-industrial (1750) to present-day (2010) tropospheric ozone RF of 410 mW m−2. The model range of pre-industrial to present-day changes in O3 produces a spread (±1 standard deviation) in RFs of ±17\%. Three different radiation schemes were used – we find differences in RFs between schemes (for the same ozone fields) of ±10\%. Applying two different tropopause definitions gives differences in RFs of ±3\%. Given additional (unquantified) uncertainties associated with emissions, climate-chemistry interactions and land-use change, we estimate an overall uncertainty of ±30\% for the tropospheric ozone RF. Experiments carried out by a subset of six models attribute tropospheric ozone RF to increased emissions of methane (44±12\%), nitrogen oxides (31 ± 9\%), carbon monoxide (15 ± 3\%) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (9 ± 2\%); earlier studies attributed more of the tropospheric ozone RF to methane and less to nitrogen oxides. Normalising RFs to changes in tropospheric column ozone, we find a global mean normalised RF of 42 mW m−2 DU−1, a value similar to previous work. Using normalised RFs and future tropospheric column ozone projections we calculate future tropospheric ozone RFs (mW m−2; relative to 1750) for the four future scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) of 350, 420, 370 and 460 (in 2030), and 200, 300, 280 and 600 (in 2100). Models show some coherent responses of ozone to climate change: decreases in the tropical lower troposphere, associated with increases in water vapour; and increases in the sub-tropical to mid-latitude upper troposphere, associated with increases in lightning and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport. Climate change has relatively small impacts on global mean tropospheric ozone RF."

abstract = "Present day tropospheric ozone and its changes between 1850 and 2100 are considered, analysing 15 global models that participated in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP). The ensemble mean compares well against present day observations. The seasonal cycle correlates well, except for some locations in the tropical upper troposphere. Most (75 \%) of the models are encompassed with a range of global mean tropospheric ozone column estimates from satellite data, but there is a suggestion of a high bias in the Northern Hemisphere and a low bias in the Southern Hemisphere, which could indicate deficiencies with the ozone precursor emissions. Compared to the present day ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden of 337 ± 23 Tg, the ensemble mean burden for 1850 time slice is ~30\% lower. Future changes were modelled using emissions and climate projections from four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Compared to 2000, the relative changes in the ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden in 2030 (2100) for the different RCPs are: −4\% (−16\%) for RCP2.6, 2\% (−7\%) for RCP4.5, 1\% (−9\%) for RCP6.0, and 7\% (18\%) for RCP8.5. Model agreement on the magnitude of the change is greatest for larger changes. Reductions in most precursor emissions are common across the RCPs and drive ozone decreases in all but RCP8.5, where doubled methane and a 40–150\% greater stratospheric influx (estimated from a subset of models) increase ozone. While models with a high ozone burden for the present day also have high ozone burdens for the other time slices, no model consistently predicts large or small ozone changes; i.e. the magnitudes of the burdens and burden changes do not appear to be related simply, and the models are sensitive to emissions and climate changes in different ways. Spatial patterns of ozone changes are well correlated across most models, but are notably different for models without time evolving stratospheric ozone concentrations. A unified approach to ozone budget specifications and a rigorous investigation of the factors that drive tropospheric ozone is recommended to help future studies attribute ozone changes and inter-model differences more clearly."

A comprehensive reference dataset of 50 case study arrival events (and 4750 associated hourly air mass history events) has been compiled, which considers the base case conditions and scenarios in which emissions of anthropogenic pollution have been reduced by factors of up to 100. The relative contributions of SOA derived from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors are presented for the range of conditions, and the composition of these simulated components is discussed in terms of average molecular formulae, atomic ratios (H/C, O/C and N/C) and organic aerosol mass to organic carbon mass ratios (OM/OC), which are compared to reported measurements. The MCM v3.1 dataset has been used as a reference benchmark for development and optimisation of a reduced (14 species) SOA module for use with version 2 the Common Representative Intermediates mechanism (CRI v2). The resultant version of the PTM containing CRI v2 and the reduced SOA module has been used to simulate the entire TORCH-2003 campaign at hourly resolution, and the contributions of SOA derived from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors are presented and discussed. The reduced SOA module is also shown to be compatible with the most reduced CRI variant (CRI v2-R5), which is considered appropriate as a traceable reference mechanism in global simulations."

The meteorological fields are based on (1) the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 1b (WACCM1b), (2) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analysis, and (3) a new reanalysis for year 2000 from ECMWF called EXP471. Model-derived tracers (methane, water vapor, and total inorganic nitrogen) and ozone are compared to data climatologies from satellites. Model mean age of air was also derived and compared to in situ CO2 and SF6 data. A detailed analysis of the chemical fields simulated by MOZART-3 shows that even though the general features characterizing the three dynamical sets are rather similar, slight differences in winds and temperature can produce substantial differences in the calculated distributions of chemical tracers. The MOZART-3 simulations that use meteorological fields from WACCM1b and ECMWF EXP471 represented best the distribution of long-lived tracers and mean age of air in the stratosphere. There was a significant improvement using the ECMWF EXP471 reanalysis data product over the ECMWF operational data product. The effect of the quasi-biennial oscillation circulation on long-lived tracers and ozone is examined.},

	abstract = "Vegetation emits large quantities of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC). At remote sites, these compounds are the dominant precursors to ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production, yet current field studies show that atmospheric models have difficulty in capturing the observed HOx cycle and concentrations of BVOC oxidation products. In this manuscript, we simulate BVOC chemistry within a forest canopy using a one-dimensional canopy-chemistry model (Canopy Atmospheric CHemistry Emission model; CACHE) for a mixed deciduous forest in northern Michigan during the CABINEX 2009 campaign. We find that the base-case model, using fully-parameterized mixing and the simplified biogenic chemistry of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Model (RACM), underestimates daytime in-canopy vertical mixing by 50-70\% and by an order of magnitude at night, leading to discrepancies in the diurnal evolution of HO x, BVOC, and BVOC oxidation products. Implementing observed micrometeorological data from above and within the canopy substantially improves the diurnal cycle of modeled BVOC, particularly at the end of the day, and also improves the observation-model agreement for some BVOC oxidation products and OH reactivity. We compare the RACM mechanism to a version that includes the Mainz isoprene mechanism (RACM-MIM) to test the model sensitivity to enhanced isoprene degradation. RACM-MIM simulates higher concentrations of both primary BVOC (isoprene and monoterpenes) and oxidation products (HCHO, MACR+MVK) compared with RACM simulations. Additionally, the revised mechanism alters the OH concentrations and increases HO 2. These changes generally improve agreement with HO x observations yet overestimate BVOC oxidation products, indicating that this isoprene mechanism does not improve the representation of local chemistry at the site. Overall, the revised mechanism yields smaller changes in BVOC and BVOC oxidation product concentrations and gradients than improving the parameterization of vertical mixing with observations, suggesting that uncertainties in vertical mixing parameterizations are an important component in understanding observed BVOC chemistry.",

The interaction of VOCs and nitrogen oxides that produces ozone and other oxidants is a critical component of air-quality simulation models. The smog chambers used for investigating this reaction are described, and results are summarized. These include chambers at the University of North Carolina, the University of California at Riverside, TVA, CSIRO in Australia, EPA, and General Motors. The chemical oxidant mechanisms that are currently being used or proposed for use in air-quality simulation models are outlined, including: the carbon bond mechanism, the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center mechanism, the EPA Regional Acid Deposition Model mechanism, the regional atmospheric chemistry mechanism, and the morphecule mechanism. The shortcomings of both the smog chamber data used to develop the mechanisms and the mechanisms themselves are identified and discussed.",

This work compares several state-of-the-science photochemical mechanisms (including LCC, CBM-IV, RADM2, EMEP, RACM, SAPRC99, and CACM which have never been compared before in other studies). Concise descriptions of the chemical schemes are included. The main difference among existing mechanisms is the lumping technique used to classify organic compounds into surrogate groups. First, box model calculations are conducted to highlight the features that lead to differences in the modeled behaviors of photochemical pollutants and their precursors. Results indicate that most chemical schemes yield similar ozone concentrations. Nevertheless, there are significant discrepancies, mainly in predicted concentration of HNO3, HO 2 and total PAN among model simulations. Finally, the sources of the discrepancy are identified.",

Much less OH and HO2 levels were observed than in the summer of 2001 at the same site. On average, the maximum daytime mixing ratios were 0.05 pptv (1.4 cm-3) for OH and 0.7 pptv for HO2, which were about one fifth of the levels in the summer of 2001. A zero-dimensional chemical model, based on the regional atmospheric chemical mechanism (RACM) and constrained by the measured concentrations of O3, NO, NO2, CO, SO2, speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and meteorological parameters, was used to study the HOx chemistry in this environment. The model generally reproduced the daytime OH well, with a median measured-to-model ratio of 0.98. However, HO2 was significantly under-predicted both at day and at night, with a median measured-to-model ratio of 6.0 during daytime. The discrepancy is pronounced when NO concentrations were high, a result that is consistent with some previous studies in urban environments. Photolysis of HONO was the dominant calculated HOx source during daytime; O3 reactions with alkenes became the main calculated HOx source at night. The main calculated HOx sink was the OH reaction with NO2. The discrepancy between measured and modeled HO2 may be caused by significant HOx production that is missing in the model. An additional HO2 production of up to 3cm-3 s-1 (1.1 pptv s-1), which is three times the calculated HOx production, is needed. This HO2 production can come either from unknown new HOx production or from unknown HO2 recycling that does not go through OH.",

	abstract = "We present an improved version of the global chemistry-general circulation model of Roelofs and Lelieveld [1997]. The major model improvement is the representation of higher hydrocarbon chemistry, implemented by means of the Carbon Bond Mechanism 4 (CBM-4). Simulated tropospheric ozone concentrations at remote locations, which agreed well with observations in the previous model version, are not affected much by the chemistry of higher hydrocarbons. However, ozone formation in the polluted boundary layer is significantly enhanced, resulting in a more realistic simulation of surface ozone in regions such as North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Our model simulates a net global tropospheric ozone production of 73 Tg yr-1 when higher hydrocarbon chemistry is considered, and -36 Tg yr-1 without higher hydrocarbon chemistry. The simulated seasonality of surface CO agrees well with observations. However, the southern hemispheric maximum for O3 and CO associated with biomass burning emissions is delayed by 1 month compared to the observations, which demonstrates the need for a better representation of biomass burning emissions. Simulated peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) concentrations agree well with observed values, although the variability is underestimated. OH decreases strongly in the continental boundary layer due to its reaction with higher hydrocarbons. However, this is almost compensated by an increase of OH over oceans in the lower half of the troposphere. Consideration of higher hydrocarbon chemistry decreases the global annual tropospheric OH concentration by about 8\% compared to a background tropospheric chemistry scheme. Further, the radiative forcing by anthropogenically increased tropospheric ozone on the northern hemisphere increases, especially in July. The forcing also increases on the southern hemisphere where biomass burning emissions produce tropospheric ozone, except between December and June, that is, outside the biomass burning season, when ozone formation is suppressed due to formation of PAN and MPAN from isoprene oxidation. Globally and annually averaged, the forcing increases only by a few percent due to higher hydrocarbon chemistry. Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.",

Meteorological data for the integrated modeling runs are extracted from MM5. Model results show O3 hourly concentrations in the range of 80-159 parts per billion (ppb) during summer in the urban areas and up to 189 ppb downwind of the city. High fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations (monthly average of 75 g m-3 in summer and 150 g m-3 in winter) are simulated over the metropolitan and down-wind areas with significant secondary constituents.

@article{Hertel:1993,
	abstract = "Two fast integration methods for chemical kinetics are tested. One is the Quasi-steady State Approximation (QSSA) method and the other is a new Euler Backward Iterative (EBI) method. The EBI method is based on iterative solution of the Euler backward approximation of a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of chemical kinetics. The efficiency of the iteration process is increased by using analytical solutions for groups of species which are strongly coupled. The accuracy of both integration methods is evaluated by comparing the results with solutions obtained by a Gear method, the Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations (LSODE). The chemical scheme used is the Carbon-bond Mechanism IV (CBM-IV). The numerical methods are tested on three chemical scenarios: two scenarios without emissions and with constant reaction rates and one scenario with variable emissions and photodissociation rates. Using a short time step (50 s), both EBI and QSSA perform very well, even under extreme chemical conditions. For larger time steps the EBI method performs better than QSSA. In the case of more realistic chemical conditions, both methods perform well even with a time step of 900 s. The accuracy of QSSA depends highly on the iteration procedure. Without iterations the QSSA method performs poorly. The great advantage of the EBI method is that concentrations are computed using linear operators only. Because of this, the method is mass conserving and can be used in air pollution transport models where higher moments of concentration distributions also need to be evaluated. Both the QSSA and the EBI methods can be recommended for use in atmospheric transport-chemistry models, where accuracy as well as computational efficiency is important. In general, the new EBI method is, however, more efficient than QSSA with a constant number of iterations.",

The measurements are described in the companion paper, Ren et al. (HOx concentrations and OH reactivity observations in New York City during PMTACS-NY2001, Atmospheric Environment, this issue). This comparison enables an investigation of HOx chemistry in this polluted urban atmosphere. For HO2, the observed concentrations and diurnal variation were usually well reproduced by the model calculations, with an observed-to-modeled ratio of 1.24, on average, for day and night. For OH, the model was generally able to match the measured concentrations during daytime with an observed-to-modeled ratio of about 1.10, but the calculations significantly underestimated OH during nighttime. The budgets of HOx show that its production was dominated by the photolysis of HONO, accounting for 56\% of HOx production on average, during daytime due to relatively high HONO concentrations, while nighttime HOx production was mainly from the O3 reactions with alkenes. The OH reactivity measurements agree with the calculations to within 10\% for both the composite diurnal variation and individual days. Calculations indicate that the reactions of OH with NO2, hydrocarbons, CO, NO, and carbonyls accounted for about 32\%, 25\%, 12\%, 10\% and 7\% of total OH loss, respectively, in this urban area. Modeled instantaneous O3 production from HO2 and RO2 reactions with NO was 150 $\plusminus$ 100ppbvday-1. O3 production rates from measured HO2(P(O3)obs HO2) was greater than modeled HO2(P(O3)calc HO2) at higher values of NO.

Total peroxy radicals RO x (HO2 + RO2) and NO x (NO + NO2) were measured together with other chemical species and physical parameters relevant to ozone production. The ozone production rate (P(O3)) was estimated from measured peroxy radicals and was found to be highly variable between days, with 30-min averaged midday values varying from 0.2 to 1.7 ppbv/h (ppbv refers to part per billion by volume). The daytime mean P(O3) for the air masses from relatively clean NE sector is close to zero, but significantly higher for air masses from more polluted W and SE sector, suggesting the impact of transport of pollutants on the remote local ozone production. The experimentally determined P(O3) is compared with those derived from a time-dependent box model based on Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling (RACM), and both the methods give the results generally in agreement. The model calculation shows that HO2 + NO reaction contributes most to ozone production, ca. 60\% at midday, followed by the reactions of CH3O2 and ISOP (peroxy radicals formed from isoprene) with NO which account for ca. 13\% and 10\% to ozone production, respectively, at noon.

Peroxy radicals were measured from 15-21 September using a peroxy radical chemical amplifier (PERCA) instrument. Simultaneously measured were O3, NO, NO2, CO, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), carbonyl compounds, aromatics, volatile organoiodines, organobromines, black carbon, aerosols and photolysis frequencies of j(O1D) and j(NO2) as well as meteorological parameters. The data set covers the measurements under relative background conditions and polluted episodes over the period. The midday 30-min averages of peroxy radicals ranged from 10 to 40 pptv with the highest observed on the event when the air masses were transported over the polluted continent in northern China before reaching the site. The significant radical signals were observed repeatedly in the early morning and late afternoon when j(O1D) was greatly reduced, resulting in the diurnal cycles of peroxy radicals much broader than those expected from the photolysis of O3 alone. A box model based on RACM (Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism) was used to calculate OH, HO2 and RO2 concentrations from measured stable species and parameters. The calculated peroxy radical concentrations agree well with measured ones during 0900-1530 Japan Standard Time (JST) (JST = UT + 9 hours) from 19 to 21 September. However, in the early morning and later afternoon when monoterpenes were the dominant VOC, the model overpredicts peroxy radicals by up to 85\%. The including of uptake of radicals to aerosols into the model cannot account for the discrepancy. An underprediction by the model up to 45\% was observed during noon hours on 18 September when isoprene concentration was high. It appears that unknown terpenes are present, which might produce extra radicals beyond the predicted by the model. The measured-to-modeled ratio of peroxy radical concentrations is near unity for [NO] \&lt; 120 pptv, but rises up to 15 for [NO] \&gt; 120 pptv, suggesting the presence of an unknown radical production process which is related with high NO concentration.",

The components also use the same timestep, hence no temporal interpolation is needed.

The WRF/Chem model is statistically evaluated and compared to MM5/Chem and to detailed photochemical data collected during the summer 2002 NEAQS field study. It is shown that the WRF/Chem model is statistically better skilled in forecasting O3 than MM5/Chem, with no appreciable differences between models in terms of bias with the observations. Furthermore, the WRF/Chem model consistently exhibits better skill at forecasting the O 3 precursors CO and NOy at all of the surface sites. However, the WRF/Chem model biases of these precursors and of other gas-phase species are persistently higher than for MM5/Chem, and are most often biased high compared to observations. Finally, we show that the impact of other basic model assumptions on these same statistics can be much larger than the differences caused by model differences. An example showing the sensitivity of various statistical measures with respect to the treatment of biogenic volatile organic compounds emissions illustrates this impact.},

	abstract = "A global three-dimensional (i.e. latitude, longitude, altitude) climatology of tropospheric ozone is derived from the ozone sounding record by trajectory mapping. Approximately 52 000 ozonesonde profiles from more than 100 stations worldwide since 1965 are used. The small number of stations results in a sparse geographical distribution. Here, forward and backward trajectory calculations are performed for each sounding to map ozone measurements to a number of other locations, and so to fill in the spatial domain. This is possible because the lifetime of ozone in the troposphere is of the order of weeks. This physically based interpolation method offers obvious advantages over typical statistical interpolation methods. The trajectory-mapped ozone values show reasonable agreement, where they overlap, to the actual soundings, and the patterns produced separately by forward and backward trajectory calculations are similar. Major regional features of the tropospheric ozone distribution are clearly evident in the global maps. An interpolation algorithm based on spherical functions is further used for smoothing and to fill in remaining data gaps. The resulting three-dimensional global tropospheric ozone climatology facilitates visualization and comparison of different years, decades, and seasons, and offers some intriguing insights into the global variation of tropospheric ozone. It will be useful for climate and air quality model initialization and validation, and as an a priori climatology for satellite data retrievals. Further division of the climatology into decadal and annual averages can provide a global view of tropospheric ozone changes, although uncertainties with regard to the performance of older sonde types, as well as more recent variations in operating procedures, need to be taken into account.",

The CCMs exhibit considerable variability in the spatial extent and location of surface O3 increases that occur within parts of high NOx emission source regions (up to 6 ppbv in the annual average and up to 14 ppbv in the season of maximum O3). In these source regions, all three CCMs show a positive relationship between surface O3 change and temperature change. Sensitivity simulations show that a combination of three individual chemical processes—(i) enhanced PAN decomposition, (ii) higher water vapor concentrations, and (iii) enhanced isoprene emission—largely reproduces the global spatial pattern of annual-mean surface O3 response due to climate change (R2 = 0.52). Changes in climate are found to exert a stronger control on the annual-mean surface O3 response through changes in climate-sensitive O3 chemistry than through changes in transport as evaluated from idealized CO-like tracer concentrations. All three CCMs exhibit a similar spatial pattern of annual-mean surface O3 change to 20\% regional O3 precursor emission reductions under future climate compared to the same emission reductions applied under present-day climate. The surface O3 response to emission reductions is larger over the source region and smaller downwind in the future than under present-day conditions. All three CCMs show areas within Europe where regional emission reductions larger than 20\% are required to compensate climate change impacts on annual-mean surface O3.},

	abstract = "Tropospheric ozone contributes to the removal of air pollutants from the atmosphere but is itself a pollutant that is harmful to human health and vegetation. Biogenic isoprene emissions are important ozone precursors, and therefore future changes in land use that change isoprene emissions are likely to affect atmospheric ozone concentrations. Here, we use the chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS (dedicated to the regional modeling of trace gases in Europe) to study a scenario in which 5\% of the crop- and grass-land in Europe is converted into poplar plantations to be used for biofuel production. Although this scenario is rather conservative, our simulations project that isoprene emissions are substantially increased by an average of 45\% over the simulated domain. As a consequence, ozone peak values are expected to increase by up to 6\%, and ozone indicators for damage to human health and vegetation by up to 25\% and 40\%, respectively. Finally, we show that after the change in land use NOx emission reductions of 15-20\% in Europe would be required to restore the ozone levels to current values. Because biomass production is expected to increase throughout Europe in the coming decades, we conclude that careful consideration of the tree types and regions to be used is required to constrain the concomitant air pollution to a minimum.",

The simulations are evaluated against ozone measurements for 2006, exhibiting good agreement between the model-predicted measurements and the measured annual cycles. Under the RCP6 emission scenario used in these simulations, average ozone mixing ratios are set to reduce by 2.0 ppb over domains encompassing Europe and the North East Atlantic between 2006 and 2100 with the most significant decrease occurring after 2050 due to the pattern in changing emissions. Peak reductions of more than 8 ppb are observed during summer time over mainland Europe by 2100. Model output was studied for three relevant sub-domains, namely the North East Atlantic, Ireland and Europe. The relative contribution of changes in both emissions and meteorology is assessed. Over the whole domain, changing emissions are predominantly responsible for changes in surface ozone; although over the North East Atlantic domain, the changing emissions do not perturb surface ozone trends and the decrease in 2100 levels is entirely attributable to changing meteorology.",

	abstract = "Global aerosol and ozone distributions and their associated radiative forcings were simulated between 1850 and 2100 following a recent historical emission dataset and under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) for the future. These simulations were used in an Earth System Model to account for the changes in both radiatively and chemically active compounds, when simulating the climate evolution. The past negative stratospheric ozone trends result in a negative climate forcing culminating at -0. 15 W m-2 in the 1990s. In the meantime, the tropospheric ozone burden increase generates a positive climate forcing peaking at 0. 41 W m-2. The future evolution of ozone strongly depends on the RCP scenario considered. In RCP4. 5 and RCP6. 0, the evolution of both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone generate relatively weak radiative forcing changes until 2060-2070 followed by a relative 30 \% decrease in radiative forcing by 2100. In contrast, RCP8. 5 and RCP2. 6 model projections exhibit strongly different ozone radiative forcing trajectories. In the RCP2. 6 scenario, both effects (stratospheric ozone, a negative forcing, and tropospheric ozone, a positive forcing) decline towards 1950s values while they both get stronger in the RCP8. 5 scenario. Over the twentieth century, the evolution of the total aerosol burden is characterized by a strong increase after World War II until the middle of the 1980s followed by a stabilization during the last decade due to the strong decrease in sulfates in OECD countries since the 1970s. The cooling effects reach their maximal values in 1980, with -0. 34 and -0. 28 W m-2 respectively for direct and indirect total radiative forcings. According to the RCP scenarios, the aerosol content, after peaking around 2010, is projected to decline strongly and monotonically during the twenty-first century for the RCP8. 5, 4. 5 and 2. 6 scenarios. While for RCP6. 0 the decline occurs later, after peaking around 2050. As a consequence the relative importance of the total cooling effect of aerosols becomes weaker throughout the twenty-first century compared with the positive forcing of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, both surface ozone and aerosol content show very different regional features depending on the future scenario considered. Hence, in 2050, surface ozone changes vary between -12 and +12 ppbv over Asia depending on the RCP projection, whereas the regional direct aerosol radiative forcing can locally exceed -3 W m-2.",

	abstract = "Gas-phase mechanisms provide important oxidant and gaseous precursors for secondary aerosol formation. Different gas-phase mechanisms may lead to different predictions of gases, aerosols, and aerosol direct and indirect effects. In this study, WRF/Chem-MADRID simulations are conducted over the continental United States for July 2001, with three different gas-phase mechanisms, a default one (i.e., CBM-Z) and two newly implemented ones (i.e., CB05 and SAPRC-99). Simulation results are evaluated against available surface observations, satellite data, and reanalysis data. The model with these three gas-phase mechanisms gives similar predictions of most meteorological variables in terms of spatial distribution and statistics, but large differences exist in shortwave radiation and temperature and relative humidity at 2 m at individual sites under cloudy conditions, indicating the importance of aerosol semi-direct and indirect effects on these variables. Large biases exist in the simulated wind speed at 10 m, cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and precipitation, due to uncertainties in current cloud microphysics and surface layer parameterizations. Simulations with all three gas-phase mechanisms well reproduce surface concentrations of O 3, CO, NO 2, and PM 2.5, and column NO 2. Larger biases exist in the surface concentrations of nitrate and organic matter (OM) and in the spatial distribution of column CO, tropospheric ozone residual, and aerosol optical depth, due to uncertainties in primary OM emissions, limitations in model representations of chemical transport, and radiative processes. Different gas-phase mechanisms lead to different predictions of mass concentrations of O 3 (up to 5 ppb), PM 2.5 (up to 0.5 g m -3), secondary inorganic PM 2.5 species (up to 1.1 g m -3), organic PM (up to 1.8 g m -3), and number concentration of PM 2.5 (up to 2 $\plusminus$ 10 4 cm -3). Differences in aerosol mass and number concentrations further lead to sizeable differences in simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) due to the feedback mechanisms among H 2SO 4 vapor, PM 2.5 number, CCN, and CDNC through gas-phase chemistry, new particle formation via homogeneous nucleation, aerosol growth, and aerosol activation by cloud droplets. This study illustrates the important impact of gas-phase mechanisms on chemical and aerosol predictions, their subsequent effects on meteorological predictions, and a need for an accurate representation of such feedbacks through various atmospheric processes in the model. The online-coupled models that simulate feedbacks between meteorological variables and chemical species may provide more accurate representations of the real atmosphere for regulatory applications and can be applied to simulate chemistry-climate feedbacks over a longer period of time.",

The robustness and variability of chemical regimes is shown. A VOC sensitive regime over North-Western Europe and a mainly NOx sensitive regime over the Mediterranean basin and Eastern Europe are found, confirming earlier published results. The chemical regime time variability, its robustness with respect to several environmental factors (seasonality, interannual variability) and with respect to model uncertainty are thoroughly analysed. For the regions with well pronounced chemical regimes over North-Western Europe and the Mediterranean, the chemical regime occurrence only slightly depends on the ozone target considered daily ozone or Ox (Combining double low line O3 + NO2) maximum or mean, AOT's, SOMO35,.. For these regions, differences between particular years and summer months are weak, day to day variability is significant but does not change the occurrence of one or another chemical regime. On the contrary, over North-Eastern Germany, the chemical regime changes form one day to another and is also dependent on the ozone target chosen. Expected decreases in anthropogenic NOx emissions over Europe since the last and for the next few decades have shifted and will shift chemical regimes to more NOx sensitive. The predictive skill of chemical regime indicator species is made evident at continental scale, extending their spatial range of applicability with respect to earlier studies. Several sensitivity tests were performed in order to account for major sources of model uncertainty. With the exception of regions near ship tracks over the Mediterranean basin, the spatial pattern of chemical regimes appears to be robust with respect to model uncertainty for all cases tested.},

	abstract = "Understanding ozone response to its precursor emissions is crucial for effective air quality management practices. This nonlinear response is usually simulated using chemical transport models, and the modeling results are affected by uncertainties in emissions inputs. In this study, a high ozone episode in the southeastern United States is simulated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Uncertainties in ozone formation and response to emissions controls due to uncertainties in emission rates are quantified using the Monte Carlo method. Instead of propagating emissions uncertainties through the original CMAQ, a reduced form of CMAQ is formulated using directly calculated first- and second-order sensitivities that capture the nonlinear ozone concentration-emission responses. This modification greatly reduces the associated computational cost. Quantified uncertainties in modeled ozone concentrations and responses to various emissions controls are much less than the uncertainties in emissions inputs. Average uncertainties in modeled ozone concentrations for the Atlanta area are less than 10\% (as measured by the inferred coefficient of variance [ICOV]) even when emissions uncertainties are assumed to vary between a factor of 1.5 and 2. Uncertainties in the ozone responses generally decrease with increased emission controls. Average uncertainties (ICOV) in emission-normalized ozone responses range from 4 to 22\%, with the smaller being associated with controlling of the relatively certain point nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions and the larger resulting from controlling of the less certain mobile NO x emissions. These small uncertainties provide confidence in the model applications, such as in performance evaluation, attainment demonstration, and control strategy development.

	abstract = "Chemically active climate compounds are either primary compounds like methane (CH4), removed by oxidation in the atmosphere, or secondary compounds like ozone (O3), sulfate and organic aerosols, both formed and removed in the atmosphere. Man-induced climate-chemistry interaction is a two-way process: Emissions of pollutants change the atmospheric composition contributing to climate change through the aforementioned climate components, and climate change, through changes in temperature, dynamics, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric stability, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions, affects the atmospheric composition and oxidation processes in the troposphere. Here we present progress in our understanding of processes of importance for climate-chemistry interactions, and their contributions to changes in atmospheric composition and climate forcing. A key factor is the oxidation potential involving compounds like O3 and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Reported studies represent both current and future changes. Reported results include new estimates of radiative forcing based on extensive model studies of chemically active climate compounds like O3, and of particles inducing both direct and indirect effects. Through EU projects like ACCENT, QUANTIFY, and the AeroCom project, extensive studies on regional and sector-wise differences in the impact on atmospheric distribution are performed. Studies have shown that land-based emissions have a different effect on climate than ship and aircraft emissions, and different measures are needed to reduce the climate impact. Several areas where climate change can affect the tropospheric oxidation process and the chemical composition are identified. This can take place through enhanced stratospheric-tropospheric exchange of ozone, more frequent periods with stable conditions favoring pollution build up over industrial areas, enhanced temperature induced biogenic emissions, methane releases from permafrost thawing, and enhanced concentration through reduced biospheric uptake. During the last 5-10 years, new observational data have been made available and used for model validation and the study of atmospheric processes. Although there are significant uncertainties in the modeling of composition changes, access to new observational data has improved modeling capability. Emission scenarios for the coming decades have a large uncertainty range, in particular with respect to regional trends, leading to a significant uncertainty range in estimated regional composition changes and climate impact.",

Box models of each of the mechanisms as they are implemented in the NAQFC were created and a set of 12 sensitivity simulations was designed. The sensitivity simulations independently probed the conceptual mechanistic differences between CB05 and CBMIV and were exercised over a 45-scenario simulation suite designed to emulate the wide range of chemical regimes encountered in a continental-scale atmospheric chemistry model. Results of the sensitivity simulations indicate that two sets of reactions that were included in the CB05 mechanism, but which were absent from the CBMIV mechanism, are the primary causes of the greater ozone production in the CB05 version of the NAQFC. One set of reactions recycles the higher organic peroxide species of CB05 (ROOH), resulting in additional photochemically reactive products that act to produce additional ozone in some chemical regimes. The other set of reactions recycles reactive nitrogen from less reactive forms back to NO2, increasing the effective NOx concentration of the system. In particular, the organic nitrate species (NTR), which was a terminal product for reactive nitrogen in the CBMIV mechanism, acts as a reservoir species in CB05 to redistribute NOx from major source areas to potentially NOx-sensitive areas where additional ozone may be produced in areas remote from direct NOx sources.",

The model permits (indeed, it requires) partitioning of a given compound i to occur even when i is present at a level below its saturation vapor pressure. During early periods of SOA formation, to determine the partitioning for each compound of interest, the model must be solved iteratively for each time and location of interest. Iteration is required because the partitioning is assumed to be governed by mole fraction concentrations in the om phase, and because prior to solving the problem, one does not know the total number of mols of condensed compounds in the om phase. During later stages of SOA formation, if the amount and general composition of the SOA begin to become constant, the partitioning coefficient of each of the compounds will also stabilize, and an iterative solution will be less needed. A partitioning model is developed to allow the modeling of the dynamics of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. The gas/aerosol partitioning is assumed to be governed by equilibrium partitioning into an absorptive, well-mixed liquid (or at least amorphous) organic matter (om) phase. The model is represented using a set of coupled linear equations. It may be especially applicable when photochemical smog is being formed in the summer.

As part of this evaluation, it was necessary to include a representation of the reactions of the alkenes with O( 3P), which are significant under chamber conditions but generally insignificant under atmospheric conditions. The simulations for the ethene and propene systems, in particular, were found to be sensitive to the branching ratios assigned to molecular and free radical forming pathways of the O( 3P) reactions, with the extent of radical formation required for proper fitting of the model to the chamber data being substantially lower than the reported consensus. With this constraint, the MCM v3 mechanisms for ethene and propene generally performed well. The sensitivity of the simulations to the parameters applied to a series of other radical sources and sink reactions (radical formation from the alkene ozonolysis reactions and product carbonyl photolysis; radical removal from the reaction of OH with NO2 and 2-hydroxynitrate formation) were also considered, and the implications of these results are discussed. Evaluation of the MCM v3 1-butene and 1-hexene degradation mechanisms, using a more limited dataset from only one chamber, was found to be inconclusive. The results of sensitivity studies demonstrate that it is impossible to reconcile the simulated and observed formation of ozone in these systems for ranges of parameter values which can currently be justified on the basis of the literature. As a result of this work, gaps and uncertainties in the kinetic, mechanistic and chamber database are identified and discussed, in relation to both tropospheric chemistry and chemistry important under chamber conditions which may compromise the evaluation procedure, and recommendations are made for future experimental studies. Throughout the study, the performance of the MCM v3 chemistry was also simultaneously compared with that of the corresponding chemistry in the SAPRC-99 mechanism, which was developed and optimized in conjunction with the chamber datasets.",

	abstract = {The modeling of dispersion of reacting pollutants in the atmosphere requires proper description of both the chemistry involved and the transport of pollutants. We present here highly reduced chemical schemes for rural and urban dispersion problems based on the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) technique. CSP identifies the steady-state species for removal, by resolving the "fast" and the "slow" chemistry components. Here, the CSP method is employed for the reduction of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM), which includes 77 species and 237 reactions. Three cases were tested: (1) a polluted scenario including ground emissions, (2) a relatively cleaner environment with 10\% of the emission levels of case 1, and finally (3) rural conditions without any emissions, for which the effects of emissions on the reduction procedure were directly studied. It was found that reduced mechanisms with high degree of reduction, down to a 16 step mechanism, i.e., 56 species in steady state, produced excellent results for most species for all cases. These reduced mechanisms did not change much between urban or rural conditions and the inclusion of emissions did not affect significantly the selection of major species. This indicates the persistence of a well-defined fast subset of the mechanism, suggesting that the produced reduced mechanisms are valid for a wide range of conditions in the atmosphere.

Intercomparisons of the simulations and comparisons with observations allow us to assess the impact of each parameterization and numerical approximation and the robustness of the model.

The case study is a four-month simulation of ozone concentrations over Europe in 2001 performed using the modeling system Polyphemus. It is shown that there is a high uncertainty due to the physical parameterizations (notably the turbulence closure and the chemical mechanism).

	abstract = "The performance of the Multiscale Air Quality Simulation Platform (MAQSIP) in simulating the regional distributions of tropospheric ozone and paniculate matter (PM) is evaluated through comparisons of model results from three-dimensional simulations against available surface and aircraft measurements. These applications indicate that the model captures the dynamic range of observations and the spatial trends represented in measurements. Some discrepancies also exist, however, and they are discussed in the context of model formulation, input data specification and assumptions, and variability and bias in measurements. The daily normalized bias (within 20\%) and normalized gross errors (\&lt;25\%) for predicted surface level O 3 over an entire summer season are within the suggested performance criteria for management evaluation studies and are comparable to, if not smaller than, those reported previously for other regional O 3 models. Comparisons of modeled PM composition with speciated fine particle concentration measurements show that the model is able to capture the spatial variability in fine PM mass as well as in the inorganic component fractions. Both measurements and model results show that in the summertime in the eastern U.S., SO 2- 4 is a relatively large component of fine PM mass; in contrast, NO - 3 is a significant fraction in the western U.S. in the wintertime case studied. The ability of the model to simulate the observed visibility indices (extinction coefficient and deciview) are evaluated through comparisons of model estimates using both a detailed Mie theory-based calculation (based on predicted aerosol size and number distributions) and an empirical mass reconstruction algorithm. Both modeled and observed data show that among the various aerosol components, in the eastern U.S. SO 2- 4 contributes the largest fraction to the aerosol extinction (35-85\%), while organic mass contributes up to 20-25\%. In contrast, in the western U.S., SO 2- 4 and NO - 3 have comparable contributions (20-50\%) to the observed aerosol extinction. Comparisons with limited observational aircraft data, however, show moderate to poor correlation with measurements in the free troposphere. While these discrepancies can be attributed in part to model initialization and lateral boundary conditions specification, there is a need for further evaluation of the representation of boundary layer-free troposphere exchange mechanisms as well as the chemical mechanisms currently used in the model for representing chemistry in the free troposphere.",

Input data are a list of species and their source strengths (emissions or atmospheric production), kinetic data and lumping group definitions. All these input data can be changed by the user in order to generate a mechanism which is adapted to the needs of the user and to the conditions of the modelling area. The programme converts the information about the chemical structure of each species into a number code which contains all necessary information about the atoms of this molecule and the way they are connected to each other. For describing a chemical reaction the code is modified in a well-defined way which corresponds to the change in the molecule structure which in reality occurs during this reaction. This number code is also used to identify species for which experimental kinetic data are available or for employing structure-reactivity relationships for estimating kinetic data. To enable lumping to be as flexible as possible all organic mechanism species can be defined by their functional groups, their reactivity, and their chain lengths. CHEMATA compares these definitions with the number codes of the real species in order to determine the correct lumping group for each real species. Then the lumped mechanism is produced considering the source strengths of all real species. As an application of CHEMATA two sensitivity studies were performed: one on the influence of species lumping by extending and reducing the regional atmospheric chemistry mechanism and the other on the influence of updating the kinetic data for the kinetics of oxy radical reactions.",

The 3D tests are performed in the domains of Milan, Mexico City and Bogota. The three domains present different chemical and meteorological conditions, which are used to test the behaviour of the four mechanisms in different situations. Three emission scenarios are simulated: the whole emission inventory, 35\% NO x reduction and 35\% VOC reduction. The comparison of the four mechanisms is performed for O3, NOx, aldehydes and peroxy radicals. Only the small mechanism presents significant differences in ozone concentrations. RO2 and aldehyde differences are important with the reduced and the small mechanism, which share a new RO2 parameterisation. Compared to RACM, the small mechanism shows very large differences for aldehydes and RO2. The extended mechanism and RACM show almost the same ozone response to emissions reduction strategies, and the reduced mechanism presents differences in the range of 10\% with respect to the extended mechanisms. The small mechanism is found to be the most VOC sensitive and therefore presents very different results from the other when emissions are modified. The results indicate a strong restriction to the use of the small mechanism in 3D models. Finally, the calculation time required for the calculation of a simulation with the four mechanisms is compared.",

We developed and applied an integrated modeling framework to assess potential O 3-related health impacts in future decades under a changing climate. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model at 4resolution was linked to the Penn State/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model 5 and the Community Multiscale Air Quality atmospheric chemistry model at 36 km horizontal grid resolution to simulate hourly regional meteorology and O 3 in five summers of the 2050s decade across the 31-county New York metropolitan region. We assessed changes in O 3-related impacts on summer mortality resulting from climate change alone and with climate change superimposed on changes in O 3 precursor emissions and population growth. Considering climate change alone, there was a median 4.5\% increase in O 3-related acute mortality across the 31 counties. Incorporating O 3 precursor emission increases along with climate change yielded similar results. When population growth was factored into the projections, absolute impacts increased substantially. Counties with the highest percent increases in projected O 3 mortality spread beyond the urban core into less densely populated suburban counties. This modeling framework provides a potentially useful new tool for assessing the health risks of climate change.",

Also, many significant technological advances in air pollution control equipment, such as the automobile exhaust gas catalytic converter, have led to effective reduction of emissions from a variety of major pollution sources. Finally, remarkable developments in instrumentation for sampling the trace species in the atmosphere have been and continue to be made. Relatively less progress has been made in understanding the biological mechanisms by which pollutants lead to human injury and mortality. In this review the focus is on the extraordinary progress that has been made over the last half century in understanding the atmospheric nature and behavior of pollutants, both gaseous and particulate. A major breakthrough was the determination of the gas-phase chemistry of both the natural and polluted atmosphere, chemistry that leads to the formation of ozone and a vast array of oxidized molecules. The mechanisms of the oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide, one of the main primary pollutants, were elucidated. Finally, the chemistry, physics, and optics of atmospheric particulate matter (aerosols) have been laid open by many stunning research achievements. Whereas 50 years ago air pollution was thought to be confined to the area around a city, it is now recognized that species emitted on one continent frequently find their way to other continents.

These models integrate several 'process' elements from source emissions to meteorological and chemical phenomena. Through field campaigns, new knowledge has become available which has enabled workers to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of AQMs and their components. Examples of insightful results include: (a) reconciliation of ambient concentrations of speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with estimates from emissions models, and inventories, (b) verification of chemical mechanisms for ozone formation from its precursors using approximations applicable in different chemical regimes, (c) inference of regimes of sensitivity in ozone concentration to changes in VOC and NO(x) precursors from ozone management practices, (d) conceptualization of important air mass transport and mixing processes on different spatial and temporal scales that affect ozone and precursor concentrations distributions, and (e) application of the analysis of spatial and temporal variance to infer the origins of chemical product transport, and precursor distributions. Studies from the first category have been used to improve emissions models substantially over previous forms. The remainder of the analyses has yielded valuable insight into the chemical and meteorological mechanisms at work on different spatial and temporal scales. The methods have provided an observationally based framework for effective choices to improve ozone management, notably in terms of NO(x) or VOC sensitive regimes. Investigation of meteorological processes relevant to ozone accumulation has illustrated the importance of accounting for both transport winds and the day-night vertical structure of the atmosphere in AQM analyses. Finally, variance analyses of O3 concentrations with other aerometric parameters offer significant opportunities to use semi-empirically air monitoring data as a means determining space and time scales of O3 variance, and detecting precursor emissions source-ozone receptor relationships. An overview is given on selected approaches recently adopted to analyze observations from field experiments that characterize the tropospheric physics and chemistry of ozone and related oxidation products. To date, the covered approaches have provided an observationally based framework for effective choices to improve ozone management. Some of the ways measurements from field campaigns have been combined to create important advances that address four important aspects of ozone management practices are illustrated. The aspects are: the use of atmospheric observations for verifying the consistency of emissions model estimates with expectations from VOC measurements in ambient air, analysis of observations to investigate basic principles of tropospheric O3 chemistry, application of meteorological features that influence O3 accumulation of different spatial scales, and determination of major climatic components of spatial variance of O3 or related species produced in the atmosphere in relation to precursor emission distributions. Examples of the four directions of analyses are described.",

The ACBM was developed from a fourth mechanism, the expanded carbon bond mechanism (CBM-EX), by explicitly including the decomposition of C2H6, C3H8, and C3H6. All three mechanisms tested were updated with the inorganic chemistry from the ACBM and implemented into the sparse-matrix, ordinary differential equation solver, SMVGEAR II. Sparse-matrix treatment in SMVGEAR II reduced the number of calculations during matrix decomposition for the MCM by a factor of 15,000 (99.995\%), or from an estimated 154h to 37s of cpu time per simulation day in one grid cell on an SGI origin 2000, in comparison with a full-matrix solution. Computer time for each mechanism was linearly proportional to the number of species in the mechanism. It is shown that the three mechanisms agreed closely when aromatic concentrations were initially low in comparison with alkane, alkene, and aldehyde initial concentrations. When aromatic concentrations were initially high (higher than that observed in urban air), the yields of O3, HCHO, and PAN differed significantly among the three mechanisms although the daily maximum concentrations of these species agreed better. The aromatic representation in MCM appears to lead to systematic overprediction of ozone, according to a comparison with smog chamber data. For initial conditions taken from measurements at nine sites in Los Angeles, the daily maximum concentrations of O3, HCHO, PAN, and H2O2 predicted by the three mechanisms differed by 30-50\%, 10-40\%, 15-40\%, and 60-80\%, respectively. The relative differences between the daytime series of O3, HCHO, H2O2, and PAN predicted by the three mechanisms were 7-68\%, 7-46\%, 35-150\%, and 10-64\%, respectively. The use of the aromatic scheme of ACBM in MCM significantly reduced the disagreement with respect to ozone.

Uncertainties were also estimated for changes in ozone due to 25\% reductions in reactive organic gases (ROG), nitrogen oxides (NOx) or both. The analyses were performed for single-day box model simulations of summertime smog episodes, with uncertainties propagated using a Latin hypercube sampling scheme. The resulting uncertainties in peak ozone concentrations range from about 20 to 50\%. Uncertainties in predicted concentrations range from 15 to 30\% for HNO3, 20 to 30\% for HCHO, and 40 to 70\% for peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Except with very low concentrations, uncertainties in H2O2 range from 30 to 45\%. For the cases studied the choice between ROG or NOx reductions as most effective for lowering ozone concentrations is insensitive to uncertainties in chemical parameters. Product concentrations are most strongly affected by uncertainties in rate parameters for PAN chemistry, HNO3 formation, aromatics oxidation, the reaction of HO2 + NO, and photolysis of HCHO, NO2, and O3, and uncertainties in peroxy radical yields from aromatics and olefins oxidation.

Realistic atmospheric simulations require that the rate parameters in chemical mechanisms, especially photolysis rate parameters and rate parameters strongly affected by temperature variations, vary diurnally during a simulation. For this reason a new conceptual framework has been devised where time-dependent rate parameters are expressed as products of time-varying profiles and time- independent multipliers. For computational convenience the nominal values of the time-independent multipliers are chosen to be unity. According to the new procedure the decoupled direct method is used to calculate the derivatives of the concentrations with respect to each time-independent multiplier. These derivatives represent the sensitivity of the concentrations to the time- varying profiles of the time-dependent rate parameters. Local sensitivity coefficients for O3 and PAN were calculated for a moderately polluted scenario that was free of clouds and at a constant temperature using the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) (Stockwell et al., 1997, Journal of Geophysical Research 102, 25,847-25,879). Calculations were compared for simulations with constant as well as diurnally changing photolysis rate coefficients. The results show that sensitivity coefficients calculated using constant, average, rate parameter values may be significantly different from sensitivity coefficients calculated using time- varying rate parameters and therefore the relative importance of the mechanism's reactions may be different for the two calculations. The greatest differences in sensitivity coefficients were found for reactions with rates that have strong diurnal variations, such as photolysis, HO and NO3 reactions. It was further found that diurnally varying reactions have cumulative effects on sensitivity coefficients during the simulation of an episode that are not present when constant rate parameters are used. These results have implications, not only for sensitivity analysis and modelling, but also for the use of measurements to validate chemical models. A new conceptual framework has been devised for local sensitivity analysis. In this framework, time-dependent rate parameters are expressed as products of time-varying profiles and time-independent multipliers. According to this framework, the decoupled direct method is used to calculate the derivatives of the concentrations with respect each time-independent multiplier. Local sensitivity coefficients for O3 and PAN have been calculated for a moderately polluted scenario. Further, a comparison has been carried out between the calculations and simulations with constant as well as diurnally changing photolysis rate coefficients.",

During the atmospheric degradation of propane, various carbonyl compounds are formed, with acetone, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde among the most prominent.

Observations of the interannual variability (IAV) of tropical ozone and of global mean OH (from the methyl chloroform proxy) offer a window for understanding the sensitivity of ozone and OH to environmental factors. We present the results of simulations for 1998-2006 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) with IAV in tropical lightning constrained by satellite observations from the Lightning Imaging Sensor. We find that this imposed IAV in lightning NOx improves the ability of the model to reproduce observed IAV in tropical ozone and OH. Lightning is far more important than biomass burning in driving the IAV of tropical ozone, even though the IAV of NOx emissions from fires is greater than that from lightning. Our results indicate that the IAV in tropospheric OH is highly sensitive to lightning relative to other emissions and suggest that lightning contributes an important fraction of the observed IAV in OH inferred from the methyl chloroform proxy. Lightning affects OH through the HO2+ NO reaction, an effect compounded by positive feedback from the resulting increase in ozone production and in CO loss. We can account in the model for the observed increase in OH in 1998-2004 and for its IAV, but the model fails to explain the OH decrease in 2004-2006. We find that stratospheric ozone plays little role in driving IAV in OH during 1998-2006, in contrast to previous studies that examined earlier periods.

	abstract = "We examine the effects of ozone precursor emissions from megacities on present-day air quality using the global chemistry--climate model UM-UKCA (UK Met Office Unified Model coupled to the UK Chemistry and Aerosols model). The sensitivity of megacity and regional ozone to local emissions, both from within the megacity and from surrounding regions, is important for determining air quality across many scales, which in turn is key for reducing human exposure to high levels of pollutants. We use two methods, perturbation and tagging, to quantify the impact of megacity emissions on global ozone. We also completely redistribute the anthropogenic emissions from megacities, to compare changes in local air quality going from centralised, densely populated megacities to decentralised, lower density urban areas. Focus is placed not only on how changes to megacity emissions affect regional and global NOx and O3, but also on changes to NOy deposition and to local chemical environments which are perturbed by the emission changes. The perturbation and tagging methods show broadly similar megacity impacts on total ozone, with the perturbation method underestimating the contribution partially because it perturbs the background chemical environment. The total redistribution of megacity emissions locally shifts the chemical environment towards more NOx-limited conditions in the megacities, which is more conducive to ozone production, and monthly mean surface ozone is found to increase up to 30\% in megacities, depending on latitude and season. However, the displacement of emissions has little effect on the global annual ozone burden (0.12\% change). Globally, megacity emissions are shown to contribute ~3\% of total NOy deposition. The changes in O3, NOx and NOy deposition described here are useful for quantifying megacity impacts and for understanding the sensitivity of megacity regions to local emissions. The small global effects of the 100\% redistribution carried out in this study suggest that the distribution of emissions on the local scale is unlikely to have large implications for chemistry--climate processes on the global scale.",

We perform a statistical analysis of 21 years of ozone and temperature observations across the rural eastern U.S. The climate penalty factor is defined as the slope of the ozone/temperature relationship. For two precursor emission regimes, before and after 2002, the climate penalty factor was consistent across the distribution of ozone observations. Priorto 2002, ozone increased by an average of C. After 2002, power plant NO x emissions were reduced by 43\%, ozone levels fell 10\%, and the climate penalty factor dropped to 2.2 ppbv. NO x controls are effective for reducing photochemical smog and might lessen the severity of projected climate change penalties. Air quality models should be evaluated against these observations, and the climate penalty factor metric may be useful for evaluating the response of ozone to climate change.",

Current thinking treats NOx and organics as independent variables that limit O3 production depending on the NOx to organic ratio; in this paradigm, reducing organics either has no effect or reduces O3. We describe a theoretical counterexample where NOx and organics are strongly coupled and reducing organics increases O3 production, and illustrate the example with observations from Mexico City. This effect arises from chain termination in the HOx and NOx cycles via organic nitrate production. We show that reductions in VOC reactivity that inadvertently reduce organic nitrate production rates will be counterproductive without concurrent reductions in NOx or other organics.",

Emissions of ozone precursors appear to be lower on weekends, so the behavior of ozone concentrations on weekends may indicate the outcome of particular ozone control strategies. To examine the influence of day-of-week differences in motor vehicle emissions on ambient ozone concentrations, we combine a fuel-based motor vehicle emission inventory containing weekend-specific activity with an Eulerian photochemical airshed model applied to central California, Emissions of NO x on weekends are 30\% lower than on weekdays due to a large drop in heavy-duty diesel truck activity, and emissions of VOC are only slightly lower on weekends. In rural areas, passenger car traffic and the associated emissions are highest on Fridays and Sundays. The combination of VOC sensitivity and reduced emissions of NO x on weekends results in higher ozone concentrations on weekends. Changes in the timing of emissions also contribute to the weekend ozone effect, but sensitivity tests show that changes in emissions timing have a minor effect compared to changes in total mass of emissions on weekends. Even in situations where reductions in NO x emissions lead to higher ozone concentrations, NO x reductions may still be necessary for control of other air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, and aerosol nitrate.",

	abstract = "The emission of organic compounds from biogenic processes acts as an important source of trace gases in remote regions away from urban conurbations, and is likely to become more important in future decades due to the further mitigation of anthropogenic emissions that affect air quality and climate forcing. In this study we examine the contribution of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) towards global tropospheric composition using the global 3-D chemistry transport model TM5 and the recently developed modified CB05 chemical mechanism. By comparing regional BVOC emission estimates we show that biogenic processes act as dominant sources for many regions and exhibit a large variability in the annually and seasonally integrated emission fluxes. By performing sensitivity studies we find that the contribution of BVOC species containing between 1 to 3 carbon atoms has an impact on the resident mixing ratios of tropospheric O3 and CO, accounting for 2.5\% and 10.8\% of the simulated global distribution, respectively. This is approximately a third of the cumulative effect introduced by isoprene and the monoterpenes. By examining an ensemble of 3-D global chemistry transport simulations which adopt different global BVOC emission inventories we determine the associated uncertainty introduced towards simulating the composition of the troposphere for the year 2000. By comparing the model ensemble values against a composite of atmospheric measurements we show that the effects on tropospheric O3 are limited to the lower troposphere (with an uncertainty between -2\% to 10\%), whereas that for tropospheric CO extends up to the upper troposphere (with an uncertainty of between 10 to 45\%). Comparing the mixing ratios for low molecular weight alkenes in TM5 against surface measurements taken in Europe implies that the cumulative emission estimates are too low, regardless of the chosen BVOC inventory. This variability in the global distribution of CO due to BVOC emissions introduces an associated uncertainty in the tropospheric CO burden of 11.4\%, which impacts strongly on the oxidative capacity of the troposphere, introducing an uncertainty in the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas CH4 of 3.3\%. This study thus identifies the necessity of placing further constraints on non-CH4 global biogenic emission estimates in large-scale global atmospheric chemistry models.",

The AN mixing ratios ranged as high as 5.2 ppbv. The median midday mixing ratio was 1.2 ppbv, and the median nighttime mixing ratio was 0.26 ppbv. These are higher mixing ratios than the sum of individual nitrates in virtually every prior study. The diurnal variation of ANs was similar to that of HNO3 and of total peroxy nitrates, with a peak near 1300 local time (LT) indicating a photochemical source. Mixing ratios decreased rapidly in the afternoon, suggesting that AN deposition is nearly as fast as HNO3 deposition. The observed correlation between O3 and ANs has a slope that increases from 29 (R2 = 0.73) ANs at 0900-1200 LT to 41 (R2 = 0.74) ANs at 1400-1800 LT. We present calculations constrained by the observed hydrocarbons showing that both the mixing ratio of ANs and the correlation of ANs with O3 are to be expected on the basis of the branching ratios for alkyl nitrate formation in the RO2 + NO reaction.

	abstract = "Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) influence air quality and global climate change through their effects on secondary air pollutants and climate forcers. Here we simulate the air quality and radiative forcing (RF) impacts of changes in ozone, methane, and sulfate from halving anthropogenic NMVOC emissions globally and from 10 regions individually, using a global chemical transport model and a standalone radiative transfer model. Halving global NMVOC emissions decreases global annual average tropospheric methane and ozone by 36.6 ppbv and 3.3 Tg, respectively, and surface ozone by 0.67 ppbv. All regional reductions slow the production of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), resulting in regional to intercontinental PAN decreases and regional NOx increases. These NOx increases drive tropospheric ozone increases nearby or downwind of source regions in the Southern Hemisphere (South America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Australia). Some regions' NMVOC emissions contribute importantly to air pollution in other regions, such as East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, whose impact on US surface ozone is 43\%, 34\%, and 34\% of North America's impact. Global and regional NMVOC reductions produce widespread negative net RFs (cooling) across both hemispheres from tropospheric ozone and methane decreases, and regional warming and cooling from changes in tropospheric ozone and sulfate (via several oxidation pathways). The 100 yr and 20 yr global warming potentials (GWP100, GWP20) are 2.36 and 5.83 for the global reduction, and 0.079 to 6.05 and -1.13 to 18.9 among the 10 regions. The NMVOC RF and GWP estimates are generally lower than previously modeled estimates, due to the greater NMVOC/NOx emissions ratios simulated, which result in less sensitivity to NMVOC emissions changes and smaller global O3 burden responses, in addition to differences in the representation of NMVOCs and oxidation chemistry among models. Accounting for a fuller set of RF contributions may change the relative magnitude of each region's impacts. The large variability in the RF and GWP of NMVOCs among regions suggest that regionally specific metrics may be necessary to include NMVOCs in multi-gas climate trading schemes.",

MHP was usually present in the order of several hundreds of pptv level, but the average mixing ratios have shown a wide range depending on the season and measuring site. Primary sources and sinks of MHP are investigated to understand the impact of meteorological and chemical parameters on the atmospheric MHP budget. The MHP/(MHP+H2O2) ratio is also presented here to examine different sensitivities of MHP and H2O2 to certain atmospheric processes. The diurnal cycle of MHP/(MHP+H2O2), which is out of phase with that of both H2O2 and MHP, could imply that MHP production is more sensitive to the ambient NO concentration, while H2O2 is more strongly influenced by the wet deposition and the subsequent aqueous chemistry. It is interesting to note that our observation at urban Beijing site in winter 2007 provides evidence for the occasional transport of MHP-containing air masses from the marine boundary layer to the continent. Furthermore, the contribution of MHP as an atmospheric oxidant to the oxidizing capacity of an air parcel is assessed based on the 'Counter Species' concept.",

Here we present daytime measurements of NO3 by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy near Houston, Texas, during the Texas Air Quality Study 2000. On 3 consecutive days in August/September 2000, NO3 reached levels from 5 ppt 3 hours before sunset to 31 ppt around sunset. Daytime NO3 had a negligible effect on the photostationary state (PSS) between O3 and NOx, with the exception of the last hour before sunset, when it significantly accelerated NO-to-NO2 conversion. On August 31, chemical reactions involving NO3 destroyed 8 (4) ppb Ox (= O3 + NO2) during the day and 27 (6) ppb at night. NO3 chemistry contributed 10 (7)\% to the total Ox loss during the daytime, and 28\% (18\%) integrated over a 24-hour period. It therefore played an important role in the Ox budget. NO3 also contributed significantly to the daytime oxidation of hydrocarbons such as monoterpenes and phenol in Houston. The observed daytime NO3 mixing ratios can be described as a function of O3 and NOx. Above [NOx]/[O3] ratios of 3\%, daytime NO3 becomes independent of NOx and proportional to the square of O3. Our calculations indicate that elevated (>1 ppt) NO3 levels can be present whenever ozone mixing ratios exceed typical urban smog levels of 100 ppb.",

The mechanism used in this study is extracted from the Master Chemical Mechanism Version 3 (MCM v3) and has been updated with new modules for cresol and g-dicarbonyl chemistry. Model simulations are carried out for a toluene-NOx experiment undertaken at the European Photoreactor (EUPHORE). The comparison of the simulation with the experimental data reveals two fundamental shortcomings in the mechanism: OH production is too low by about 80\%, and the ozone concentration at the end of the experiment is over-predicted by 55\%. The radical budget was analysed to identify the key intermediates governing the radical transformation in the toluene system. Ring-opening products, particularly conjugated g-dicarbonyls, were identified as dominant radical sources in the early stages of the experiment. The analysis of the time evolution of radical production points to a missing OH source that peaks when the system reaches highest reactivity. First generation products are also of major importance for the ozone production in the system. The analysis of the radical budget suggests two options to explain the concurrent under-prediction of OH and over-prediction of ozone in the model: 1) missing oxidation processes that produce or regenerate OH without or with little NO to NO2 conversion or 2) NO3 chemistry that sequesters reactive nitrogen oxides into stable nitrogen compounds and at the same time produces peroxy radicals. Sensitivity analysis was employed to identify significant contributors to ozone production and it is shown how this technique, in combination with ozone isopleth plots, can be used for the design of validation experiments.",

Brown as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Houston and Galveston Bay (HGB) area as part of the Texas Air Quality (TexAQS)/Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS) conducted from July-September 2006. The magnitudes of the reactivities of CH4, CO, VOCs, and NO2 with the hydroxyl radical, OH, were determined in order to quantify the contributions of these compounds to potential ozone formation. The average total OH reactivity (ROH,TOTAL) increased from 1.01 1 in the central gulf to 10.1 1 in the HGB area as a result of the substantial increase in the contribution from VOCs and NO2. The increase in the measured concentrations of reactive VOCs in the HGB area compared to the central gulf was explained by the impact of industrial emissions, the regional distribution of VOCs, and the effects of local meteorology. By compensating for the effects of boundary layer mixing, the diurnal profiles of the OH reactivity were used to characterize the source signatures and relative magnitudes of biogenic, anthropogenic (urban + industrial), and oxygenated VOCs as a function of the time of day. The source of reactive oxygenated VOCs (e.g., formaldehyde) was determined to be almost entirely from secondary production. The secondary formation of oxygenated VOCs, in addition to the continued emissions of reactive anthropogenic VOCs, served to sustain elevated levels of OH reactivity throughout the time of peak ozone production.",

    abstract = "The formation, abundance and distribution of organic nitrates are relevant for determining the production efficiency and resident mixing ratios of tropospheric ozone (O3) on both regional and global scales. Here we investigate the effect of applying the recently measured direct chemical production of methyl nitrate (CH3ONO2) during NOx recycling involving the methyl-peroxy radical on the global tropospheric distribution of CH3ONO2 and the perturbations introduced towards tropospheric NOx and O3 using the TM5 global chemistry transport model. By comparisons against numerous observations, we show that the global surface distribution of CH3ONO2 can be largely explained by introducing the chemical production mechanism using a branching ratio of 0.3\%, when assuming a direct oceanic emission source of $\sim$0.15 Tg N yr$^{-1}$. On a global scale, the chemical production of CH3ONO2 converts 1 Tg N yr$^{-1}$ from nitrogen oxide for this branching ratio. The resident mixing ratios of CH3ONO2 are found to be highly sensitive to the dry deposition velocity that is prescribed, where more than 50\% of the direct oceanic emission is lost near the source regions, thereby mitigating the subsequent effects due to long-range and convective transport out of the source region. For the higher alkyl nitrates (RONO2) we find improvements in the simulated distribution near the surface in the tropics (10 S-10 N) when introducing direct oceanic emissions equal to $\sim$0.17 Tg N yr$^{-1}$ . In terms of the vertical profile of CH3ONO2, there are persistent overestimations in the free troposphere and underestimations in the upper troposphere across a wide range of latitudes and longitudes when compared against data from measurement campaigns. This suggests either a missing transport pathway or source/sink term, although measurements show significant variability in resident mixing ratios at high altitudes at global scale. For the vertical profile of RONO2, TM5 performs better at tropical latitudes than at mid-latitudes, with similar features in the comparisons to those for CH3ONO2. Comparisons of CH3ONO2 with a wide range of surface measurements shows that further constraints are necessary regarding the variability in the deposition terms for different land surfaces in order to improve on the comparisons presented here. For total reactive nitrogen (NOy) $\sim$20\% originates from alkyl nitrates in the tropics and subtropics, where the introduction of both direct oceanic emissions and the chemical formation mechanism of CH3ONO2 only makes a $\sim$5\% contribution to the total alkyl nitrate content in the upper troposphere when compared with aircraft observations. We find that the increases in tropospheric O3 that occur due oxidation of CH3ONO2 originating from direct oceanic emission is negated when accounting for the chemical formation of CH3ONO2, meaning that the impact of such oceanic emissions on atmospheric lifetimes becomes marginal when a branching ratio of 0.3\% is adopted.",

	abstract = "Photolysis is shown to be a major sink for isoprene-derived carbonyl nitrates, which constitute an important component of the total organic nitrate pool over vegetated areas. Empirical evidence from published laboratory studies on the absorption cross sections and photolysis rates of alpha-nitrooxy ketones suggests that the presence of the nitrate group (i) greatly enhances the absorption cross sections and (ii) facilitates dissociation to a point that the photolysis quantum yield is close to unity, with O-NO2 dissociation as a likely major channel. On this basis, we provide new recommendations for estimating the cross sections and photolysis rates of carbonyl nitrates. The newly estimated photo rates are validated using a chemical box model against measured temporal profiles of carbonyl nitrates in an isoprene oxidation experiment by Paulot et al. (2009). The comparisons for ethanal nitrate and for the sum of methacrolein- and methyl vinyl ketone nitrates strongly supports our assumptions of large cross-section enhancements and a near-unit quantum yield for these compounds. These findings have significant atmospheric implications: the photorates of key carbonyl nitrates from isoprene are estimated to be typically between 3 and 20 times higher than their sink due to reaction with OH in relevant atmospheric conditions. Moreover, since the reaction is expected to release NO2, photolysis is especially effective in depleting the total organic nitrate pool.",

PAN enables the transport and release of NOx to the remote troposphere with major implications for the global distributions of ozone and OH, the main tropospheric oxidants. Simulation of PAN is a challenge for global models because of the dependence of PAN on vertical transport as well as complex and uncertain NMVOC sources and chemistry. Here we use an improved representation of NMVOCs in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and show that it can simulate PAN observations from aircraft campaigns worldwide. The immediate carbonyl precursors for PAN formation include acetaldehyde (44\% of the global source), methylglyoxal (30\%), acetone (7\%), and a suite of other isoprene and terpene oxidation products (19\%). A diversity of NMVOC emissions is responsible for PAN formation globally including isoprene (37\%) and alkanes (14\%). Anthropogenic sources are dominant in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere outside the growing season. Open fires appear to play little role except at high northern latitudes in spring, although results are very sensitive to plume chemistry and plume rise. Lightning NOx is the dominant contributor to the observed PAN maximum in the free troposphere over the South Atlantic.",

A global 3-D tropospheric chemistry/transport model (IMPACT) has been exercised initially using the GEOS-Chem chemical reaction mechanism. The model was then extended by adding emissions and photochemical reactions for aromatic and terpenoid hydrocarbons, and by adding explicit representation of hydroxy alkyl nitrates produced from isoprene. Emissions of methanol, phenol, acetic acid and formic acid associated with biomass burning were also added. Resultsshow that O3 increases by 20\% in most of the troposphere, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) increases by 30\% over much of the troposphere and OH increases by 10\%. NOx (NO + NO2) decreases near source regions and increasesin remote locations, reflecting increased transport of NOx away from source regions by organic nitrates. The increase in O3 was driven largely by the increased role of PAN as a transporter of NOx and by the rerelease of NOx from isoprene nitrates. The increased PAN production was associated with increases in methyl glyoxal and hydroxyacetone. Comparison with measured values show reasonable agreement for O3 and PAN, but model measurement agreement does not either improve or degrade in the extended model. The extended model shows improved agreement with measurements for methanol, acetic acid and peroxypropional nitrate (PPN). Results from the extended model were consistent with measured alkyl nitrates and glycolaldehyde, but hydroxyacetone and methyl glyoxal were overestimated. The latter suggests that the effect of the isoprene nitrates is somewhat smaller than estimated here. Although the model measurement comparison does not show specific improvements with the extended model, it provides a more complete description of tropospheric chemistry that we believe is important to include.",

This maximum contrasts with ozone mixing ratios lower than 20 ppbv measured at the same altitudes in equatorial regions. Analyses with a global chemical transport model suggest that these elevated ozone values are part of a large-scale tropospheric ozone plume extending from Africa to the western Pacific across the Indian ocean. These plumes occur several months after the peak in biomass burning influence and during a period of high lightning activity in the Southern Hemisphere tropical belt. The composition and geographical extent of these plumes are similar to the ozone layers previously encountered during the biomass burning season in this region.Our model results suggest that production of nitrogen oxides from lightning strokes sustains the NOx (= NO+NO2) levels and the ozone photochemical production required in the upper troposphere to form these persistent elevated ozone layers emanating from biomass burning regions.",

	abstract = "This study describes a simple parameterization to estimate regionally averaged changes in surface ozone due to past or future changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions based on results from 14 global chemistry transport models. The method successfully reproduces the results of full simulations with these models. For a given emission scenario it provides the ensemble mean surface ozone change, a regional source attribution for each change, and an estimate of the associated uncertainty as represented by the variation between models. Using the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios as an example, we show how regional surface ozone is likely to respond to emission changes by 2050 and how changes in precursor emissions and atmospheric methane contribute to this. Surface ozone changes are substantially smaller than expected with the SRES A1B, A2 and B2 scenarios, with annual global mean reductions of as much as 2 ppb by 2050 vs. increases of 4-6 ppb under SRES, and this reflects the assumptions of more stringent precursor emission controls under the RCP scenarios. We find an average difference of around 5 ppb between the outlying RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, about 75\% of which can be attributed to differences in methane abundance. The study reveals the increasing importance of limiting atmospheric methane growth as emissions of other precursors are controlled, but highlights differences in modelled ozone responses to methane changes of as much as a factor of two, indicating that this remains a major uncertainty in current models.",

At the surface in the western United States, Asian ozone (O3A) mixing ratios are maximum in the spring at 3.36 $\plusminus$ 1.3 ppbv and are minimum in the summer at 1.36 $\plusminus$ 0.7 ppbv (mean $\plusminus$ standard deviation over time). Transport of O3A and its precursors to the surface in the United States depends on the structure of the elevated O3A plume and on available meteorological transport mechanisms, such as dry air streams associated with midlatitude cyclones, which can transport air from plumes with elevated levels of Asian pollution in the free troposphere to the surface. We show that the structure of such plumes has a strong seasonal dependence, entering the United States in the spring, widely dispersed between roughly 0 to 6 km and 20N to 50N in the lower free troposphere and boundary layer, with O3A mixing ratios between 5 and 10 ppbv.

We find the daytime speciated organic reactivity with respect to OH during CalNex-SJV has a temperature-independent portion with molecules typically associated with motor vehicles being the major component. At high temperatures, characteristic of days with high ozone, the largest portion of the total organic reactivity increases exponentially with temperature and is dominated by small, oxygenated organics and molecules that are unidentified.

Large-scale effects from such changes on chemically produced tropospheric aerosols have not been systematically examined in past studies. We use a composition-climate model to investigate potential past and future impacts of changes in stratospheric ozone depleting substances (ODS) on tropospheric oxidants and sulfate aerosols. In most experiments, we find significant responses in tropospheric photolysis and oxidants, with small but significant effects on methane radiative forcing. The response of sulfate aerosols is sizeable when examining the effect of increasing future nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. We also find that without the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through the Montreal Protocol, sulfate aerosols could have increased by 2050 by a comparable amount to the decreases predicted due to relatively stringent sulfur emissions controls. The individual historical radiative forcings of CFCs and N2O through their indirect effects on methane (-22.6 mW m-2 for CFCs and -6.7 mW m-2 for N2O) and sulfate aerosols (-3.0 mW m-2 for CFCs and +6.5 mW m-2 for N2O when considering the direct aerosol effect) discussed here are non-negligible when compared to known historical ODS forcing.

A parameterized regression developed for rural air was adapted to central Queens, New York City, i.e., considerable fresh emissions. Measurements of the radicals [HO2] and [OH] were available. These provided explicit reference estimates of the predominant terms for chemical ozone production, Po(O3) = k[HO2][NO], of the predominant chemical loss of nitrogen oxides, L(NO2) = k[OH][NO2], and also their ratio. (This is termed a production efficiency for O3.) Chemical modeling supports a robust extension from Po(O3) to total chemical production, P(O3). The two regression variables, [NO] and jHCHO=>rads x [HCHO], which best explain Po(O3), have low correlation, R ~ 0.2 (variable, interacting urban plumelets?). In our analysis, R2 for Po(O3) (and an estimate for its rate-determining [HO2]) was in the range 0.48-0.81. Signally, the method suggests a quantitative and very local application of descriptions of 'VOC limitation' or 'NOx limitation' to P(O3) and L(NO2), expressed as dimensionless sensitivity variables. Unexpected sources, transport, or chemistry may be highlighted using only HCHO, NOx, and UV radiation. More complex relationships are needed in a focused analysis of intermediate polluted situations, where timescales or individual sources may give trouble. Here, we find that T is informative, and cooperates with j x [HCHO] in defining [HO2]. Sensitivities for radicals and NO for Po(O3) are similar ~0.4, but sensitivities for radicals and NO2 for L(NO2) emphasize NO2. Remaining variability in the statistical estimates of Po(O3) and L(NO2) is modulated by incompletely understood, slowly varying gain factors. Understanding of these gain factors promises a better empirical indicator for Po(O3)/L(NO2). Complete 3-d simulations are not replaced, but this view helps separate sub-problems in the estimation of HO2 and P(O3).",

	abstract = "A reduced mechanism to describe the formation of ozone from VOC oxidation has been developed, using the master chemical mechanism (MCM v2) as a reference benchmark. The 'common representative intermediates' (CRI) mechanism treats the degradation of methane and 120 VOC using ca. 570 reactions of ca. 250 species (i.e. the emitted VOC plus an average of about one additional species per VOC). It thus contains only ca. 5\% of the number of reactions and ca. 7\% of the number of chemical species in MCM v2, providing a computationally economical alternative. The CRI mechanism contains a series of generic intermediate radicals and products, which mediate the breakdown of larger VOC into smaller fragments (e.g., formaldehyde), the chemistry of which is treated explicitly. A key assumption in the mechanism construction methodology is that the potential for ozone formation from a given VOC is related to the number of reactive (i.e., C-C and C-H) bonds it contains, and it is this quantity which forms the basis of the generic intermediate groupings. Following a small degree of optimisation, the CRI mechanism is shown to generate levels of ozone, OH, peroxy radicals, NO and NO2 which are in excellent agreement with those calculated using MCM v2, in simulations using a photochemical trajectory model applied previously to simulation of episodic ozone formation. The same model is used to calculate photochemical ozone creation potentials for 63 alkanes, alkenes, carbonyls and alcohols using both mechanisms. Those determined with the CRI mechanism show a variation from compound to compound which is remarkably consistent with that calculated with the detailed chemistry in MCM v2. This suggests that the CRI mechanism construction methodology is able to capture both the salient features of the ozone formation process in general, and how this varies from one VOC to another.",

	abstract = "The continuing growth of the world's urban population has led to an increasing number of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. The higher emissions of pollutants, coupled to higher population density, makes predictions of air quality in these megacities of particular importance from both a science and a policy perspective. Global climate models are typically run at coarse resolution to enable both the efficient running of long time integrations, and the ability to run multiple future climate scenarios. However, when considering surface ozone concentrations at the local scale, coarse resolution can lead to inaccuracies arising from the highly nonlinear ozone chemistry and the sensitivity of ozone to the distribution of its precursors on smaller scales. In this study, we use UM-UKCA, a global atmospheric chemistry model, coupled to the UK Met Office Unified Model, to investigate the impact of model resolution on tropospheric ozone, ranging from global to local scales. We focus on the model's ability to represent the probability of high ozone concentrations in the summer and low ozone concentrations, associated with polluted megacity environments, in the winter, and how this varies with horizontal resolution. We perform time-slice integrations with two model configurations at typical climate resolution (CR, ~150 km) and at a higher resolution (HR, ~40 km). The CR configuration leads to overestimation of ozone concentrations on both regional and local scales, while it gives broadly similar results to the HR configuration on the global scale. The HR configuration is found to produce a more realistic diurnal cycle of ozone concentrations and to give a better representation of the probability density function of ozone values in urban areas such as the megacities of London and Paris. We find the observed differences in model behaviour between CR and HR configurations to be largely caused by chemical differences during the winter and meteorological differences during the summer.",

	abstract = "An accurate speciation mapping of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emissions has an important impact on the performance of chemical transport models (CTMs) in simulating ozone mixing ratios and secondary organic aerosols. Taking the INTEX-B Asian NMVOC emission inventory as the case, we developed an improved speciation framework to generate model-ready anthropogenic NMVOC emissions for various gas-phase chemical mechanisms commonly used in CTMs in this work, by using an explicit assignment approach and updated NMVOC profiles. NMVOC profiles were selected and aggregated from a wide range of new measurements and the SPECIATE database v.4.2. To reduce potential uncertainty from individual measurements, composite profiles were developed by grouping and averaging source profiles from the same category. The fractions of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) were corrected during the compositing process for those profiles which used improper sampling and analyzing methods. Emissions of individual species were then lumped into species in different chemical mechanisms used in CTMs by applying mechanism-dependent species mapping tables, which overcomes the weakness of inaccurate mapping in previous studies. Emission estimates for individual NMVOC species differ between one and three orders of magnitude for some species when different sets of profiles are used, indicating that source profile is the most important source of uncertainties of individual species emissions. However, those differences are diminished in lumped species as a result of the lumping in the chemical mechanisms. Gridded emissions for eight chemical mechanisms at 30 min x 30 min resolution as well as the auxiliary data are available at http://mic.greenresource.cn/intex-b2006. The framework proposed in this work can be also used to develop speciated NMVOC emissions for other regions.",

	abstract = "Elevated ground-level ozone (O3), reflecting atmospheric oxidative capacity, are of increasing concern. High levels of total oxidants (Ox= O3 + NO2) have been persistently observed as a feature of Beijing's air pollution. Beijing is a well-known megacity requiring the enforcement of stringent air quality controls as rapid economic growth continues. To evaluate the effect of air quality controls in recent years, ground-based on-line measurements at an urban site were conducted in summer and the variations in O3 with simultaneous changes in NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) between 2005 and 2011 were analyzed. Both NOx and total VOCs in Beijing decreased over the study period, 1.4 ppbv yr-1 and 1.6 ppbv yr-1, respectively. However, VOCs reactivity, in terms of OH loss rate, showed an indistinct statistical trend due to unsteady variations from naturally emitted isoprene, though some anthropogenic species showed decreasing trends, such as pentane, benzene and toluene. Meanwhile, daytime average O3 increased rapidly at an annual rate of 2.6 ppbv yr-1, around 5\% yr-1 between 2005 and 2011. Considering the influence of NO titration effect and elevated regional ozone background in the North China Plain (NCP), the main reason for such an increase in oxidants was subject to 'local' photochemistry. A simplified model was used to evaluate the effect of changes in the levels of ozone precursors on ozone production. We found that between 2001 and 2006, the production rate of total oxidants, P(Ox) increased rapidly due to increased VOC levels and decreasing NO2, while from 2006 to 2011 P(Ox) remained high, though decreased slightly as a consequence of the decrease in both VOC reactivity (-5\% yr-1) and NOx (-4\% yr-1). Observations have shown that Beijing's efforts to control air pollution were somehow effective in cutting ozone precursors, but still left higher ground-level ozone. We surmised that it resulted from potential contributions from OVOCs and regional transport near Beijing. Therefore, Beijing needs deeper cooperation with adjacent provinces to control ozone pollution together. To impel this kind of joint prevention and control program, ground-level ozone should become a mandatory index for air quality management, and a faster reduction of VOCs, especially reactive VOCs, in urban areas, should coordinate with national NOx emission control programs.",

	abstract = "Hydroxyl (OH) radicals play a vital role in maintaining the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. To understand variations in OH radicals both source and sink terms must be understood. Currently the overall sink term, or the total atmospheric reactivity to OH, is poorly constrained. Here, we present a new on-line method to directly measure the total OH reactivity (i.e.~total loss rate of OH radicals) in a sampled air mass. In this method, a reactive molecule (X), not normally present in air, is passed through a glass reactor and its concentration is monitored with a suitable detector. OH radicals are then introduced in the glass reactor at a constant rate to react with X, first in the presence of zero air and then in the presence of ambient air containing VOCs and other OH reactive species. Comparing the amount of X exiting the reactor with and without the ambient air allows the air reactivity to be determined. In our existing set up, X is pyrrole and the detector used is a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer. The present dynamic range for ambient air reactivity is about 6 to 300 s−1, with an overall maximum uncertainty of 25\% above 8 s−1 and up to 50\% between 6--8 s−1. The system has been tested and calibrated with different single and mixed hydrocarbon standards showing excellent linearity and accountability with the reactivity of the standards. Potential interferences such as high NO in ambient air, varying relative humidity and photolysis of pyrrole within the setup have also been investigated. While interferences due changing humidity and photolysis of pyrrole are easily overcome by ensuring that humidity in the set up does not change drastically and the photolytic loss of pyrrole is measured and taken into account, respectively, NO>10 ppb in ambient air remains a significant interference for the current configuration of the instrument. Field tests in the tropical rainforest of Suriname (53 s) and the urban atmosphere of Mainz (10 s-1) Germany, show the promise of the new method and indicate that a significant fraction of OH reactive species in the tropical forests is likely missed by current measurements. Suggestions for improvements to the technique and future applications are discussed.",

In most cases it simulated experimental results within the uncertainty of the data and the chamber and run characterization model. However, the photodecomposition quantum yields of methacrolein and MVK and the organic nitrate yield from the OH + isoprene reaction had to be adjusted to obtain satisfactory simulations of the data. The major discrepancy observed was that the model tended to underpredict PAN by ca. 40\% in the isoprene experiments, despite the fact that the model predicted PAN from methacrolein and MVK reasonably well.

To increase the accuracy and facilitate comparison of results from such models, it is essential they contain up-to-date chemical mechanisms. To this end, we present an evaluation of the atmospheric chemistry of the four most abundant organic peroxy radicals: CH3O2, C2H5O2, CH3C(O)O2, and CH3C(O)CH2O2. The literature data for the atmospheric reactions of these radicals are evaluated. In addition, the ultraviolet absorption cross sections for the above radicals and for HO2 have been evaluated. The absorption spectra were fitted to an analytical formula, which enabled published spectra to be screened objectively. Published kinetic and product data were reinterpreted, or in some case reanalyzed, using the new cross sections, leading to a self-consistent set of kinetic, mechanistic, and spectroscopic data. Product studies were also evaluated. A set of peroxy radical reaction rate coefficients and products are recommended for use in atmospheric modeling. A three-dimensional global chemical transport model (the Intermediate Model for the Global Evolution of Species, IMAGES) was run using both previously recommended rate coefficients and the current set to highlight the sensitivity of key atmospheric trace species to the peroxy radical chemistry used in the model.

This framework also reveals critical deficiencies in current emissions and SOA formation measurements. The key feature of this treatment is a uniform basis set of saturation vapor pressures spanning the range of ambient organic saturation concentrations, from effectively nonvolatile material at 0.01 $\mu$g m$^{-3}$ to vapor-phase effluents at 100 mg m$^{-3}$. Chemical evolution can be treated by a transformation matrix coupling the various basis vectors. Using this framework, we show that semi-volatile partitioning can be described in a self-consistent way, with realistic behavior with respect to temperature and varying organic aerosol loading.

	abstract = "Abstract The Tropics provide a reactive atmospheric environment with high levels of biogenic emissions, rapidly growing anthropogenic influence, high solar radiation and temperature levels. The major reactive biogenic emission is isoprene which reacts rapidly with the primary daytime oxidant OH, the hydroxyl radical. This key photooxidation process has recently been the focus of several experimental and computational studies. A novel isoprene degradation mechanism was recently proposed (MIME) supplementing the commonly used MCM 3.2 scheme. This study examined the photooxidation of isoprene in the controlled conditions of the Valencia atmospheric reaction chamber, EUPHORE (EUropean PHOtoREactor). Besides the detection of isoprene and its major oxidation products formaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR), the total loss rate of OH (total OH reactivity) was measured. The total OH reactivity was compared to the individual measurements of isoprene and its oxidation products to assess the significant contributors to the overall OH loss rate. Measured total OH reactivity showed excellent agreement to the calculation based on individual compounds detected by a Proton-Transfer-Reaction-Time-Of-Flight-Mass-Spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). On average 97\% of the measured total OH reactivity could be explained by isoprene and its major oxidation products. Total OH reactivity was also compared to various isoprene degradation schemes to evaluate known mechanisms. The MCM 3.2 isoprene mechanism reproduced the temporal degradation of total OH reactivity (and isoprene) reasonably well with a 57\% (and 95\%) agreement within the model uncertainties and a linear curve fit slope of 0.69 (and 1.02) for a model to measurement correlation. Large discrepancies between modeled values and all observed compounds were found for the recent isoprene oxidation scheme in MIME. Possible mechanistic reasons are discussed and improvements proposed. The subsequently modified version of MIME differed from the measured total OH reactivity only about 12\% at the end of the experiment and represented best the overall temporal profile (linear curve fit slope of correlation: 0.95).",

Simulated dicarbonyl concentrations in continental surface air at northern midlatitudes are in the range 10--100 ppt, consistent with in situ measurements. On a global scale, the highest concentrations are over biomass burning regions, in agreement with glyoxal column observations from the SCIAMACHY satellite instrument. SCIAMACHY and a few ship cruises also suggest a large marine source of dicarbonyls missing from our model. The global source of SOA from the irreversible uptake of dicarbonyls in GEOS-Chem is 11 Tg C a−1, including 2.6 Tg C a−1 from glyoxal and 8 Tg C a−1 from methylglyoxal; 90\% of this source takes place in clouds. The magnitude of the global SOA source from dicarbonyls is comparable to that computed in GEOS-Chem from the standard mechanism involving reversible partitioning of semivolatile products from the oxidation of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, isoprene, and aromatics.",

	abstract = "Two recent papers have quantified long-term ozone (O3) changes observed at northern midlatitude sites that are believed to represent baseline (here understood as representative of continental to hemispheric scales) conditions. Three chemistry-climate models (NCAR CAM-chem, GFDL-CM3, and GISS-E2-R) have calculated retrospective tropospheric O3 concentrations as part of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 model intercomparisons. We present an approach for quantitative comparisons of model results with measurements for seasonally averaged O3 concentrations. There is considerable qualitative agreement between the measurements and the models, but there are also substantial and consistent quantitative disagreements. Most notably, models (1) overestimate absolute O3 mixing ratios, on average by ~5 to 17 ppbv in the year 2000, (2) capture only $\sim$50\% of O3 changes observed over the past five to six decades, and little of observed seasonal differences, and (3) capture $\sim$25 to 45\% of the rate of change of the long-term changes. These disagreements are significant enough to indicate that only limited confidence can be placed on estimates of present-day radiative forcing of tropospheric O3 derived from modeled historic concentration changes and on predicted future O3 concentrations. Evidently our understanding of tropospheric O3, or the incorporation of chemistry and transport processes into current chemical climate models, is incomplete. Modeled O3 trends approximately parallel estimated trends in anthropogenic emissions of NOx, an important O3 precursor, while measured O3 changes increase more rapidly than these emission estimates.",

Eleven data sets (ten ground-based and one airborne) including six European (beginning in the 1950's and before), three North American (beginning in 1984) and two Asian (beginning in 1991) are analyzed. When the full time periods of the data records are considered a consistent picture emerges; O3 has increased at all sites in all seasons at approximately 1\% yr−1 relative to the site's 2000 yr mixing ratio in each season. For perspective, this rate of increase sustained from 1950 to 2000 corresponds to an approximate doubling. There is little if any evidence for statistically significant differences in average rates of increase among the sites, regardless of varying length of data records. At most sites (most definitively at the European sites) the rate of increase has slowed over the last decade (possibly longer), to the extent that at present O3 is decreasing at some sites in some seasons, particularly in summer. The average rate of increase before 2000 shows significant seasonal differences (1.08 $\plusminus$ 0.09, 0.89 $\plusminus$ 0.10, 0.85 $\plusminus$ 0.11 and 1.21 $\plusminus$ 0.12\% yr−1 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively, over North America and Europe).",

	abstract = "Both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) are powerful oxidants in ambient air that are intimately linked through atmospheric chemistry and which continuously interchange over very short timescales. Based upon atmospheric chemistry alone, there is a strong, a priori, reason for consider ing O3 and NO2 together in epidemiological studies, rather than either of the two pollutants separately in single-pollutant models. This paper compares two approaches to this, using Ox, defined as O3 +NO2, as a single metric and also using O3 and NO2 together in two-pollutant models. We hypothesised that the magnitude of the association between Ox and daily mortality would be greater than for NO2 and O3 individually. Using collocated hourly measurements for O3 and NO2 in London, from 2000 to 2005, we carried out a time series analysis of daily mortality. We investigated O3, NO2 and Ox individually in single-pollutant Poisson regression models and NO2 and O3 jointly in two-pollutant models in both all-year and season-specific analyses. We observed larger associations for mean 24-h concentrations of Ox (1.30 \% increase in mortality per 10 ppb) than for O3 (0.87 \%) and NO2 (0 \%) individually. However, when analysed jointly in two-pollutant models, associations for O3 (1.54 \%) and NO2 (1.07 \%) were comparable to the Ox association. Season-specific analyses broadly followed this pattern irrespective of whether the Ox concentrations were driven by O3 production (summer) or depletion (winter). This novel approach in air pollution epidemiology captures the simultaneous impact of both oxidants whilst avoiding many of the statistical issues associated with two-pollutant models and potentially simplifies health impact calculations.",

The benefit of European emission control measures is found to be significantly counterbalanced by increasing global O3 levels and subsequent long range transport since both are of the same magnitude (up to 4 ppbv) but opposite in sign.

In this study we compare dry deposition of ozone across 15 models which contributed to the HTAP model intercomparison to identify where differences occur. We compare modelled dry deposition of ozone to measurements made at a variety of locations in Europe and North America, noting differences of up to a factor of two but no clear systematic bias over the sites examined.

	abstract = "The MIRAGE-Shanghai experiment was designed to characterize the factors controlling regional air pollution near a Chinese megacity (Shanghai) and was conducted during September 2009. This paper provides information on the measurements conducted for this study. In order to have some deep analysis of the measurements, a regional chemical/dynamical model (version 3 of Weather Research and Forecasting Chemical model -- WRF-Chemv3) is applied for this study. The model results are intensively compared with the measurements to evaluate the model capability for calculating air pollutants in the Shanghai region, especially the chemical species related to ozone formation. The results show that the model is able to calculate the general distributions (the level and the variability) of air pollutants in the Shanghai region, and the differences between the model calculation and the measurement are mostly smaller than 30\%, except the calculations of HONO (nitrous acid) at PD (Pudong) and CO (carbon monoxide) at DT (Dongtan). The main scientific focus is the study of ozone chemical formation not only in the urban area, but also on a regional scale of the surrounding area of Shanghai. The results show that during the experiment period, the ozone photochemical formation was strongly under the VOC (volatile organic compound)-limited condition in the urban area of Shanghai. Moreover, the VOC-limited condition occurred not only in the city, but also in the larger regional area. There was a continuous enhancement of O3 concentrations in the downwind of the megacity of Shanghai, resulting in a significant enhancement of ozone concentrations in a very large regional area in the surrounding region of Shanghai. The sensitivity study of the model suggests that there is a threshold value for switching from VOC-limited condition to NOx (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide)-limited condition. The threshold value is strongly dependent on the emission ratio of NOx and VOCs. When the ratio is about 0.4, the Shanghai region is under a strong VOC-limited condition over the regional scale. In contrast, when the ratio is reduced to about 0.1, the Shanghai region is under a strong NOx -limited condition. The estimated threshold value (on the regional scale) for switching from VOC-limited to NOx -limited condition ranges from 0.1 to 0.2. This result has important implications for ozone production in this region and will facilitate the development of effective O3 control strategies in the Shanghai region.",

	abstract = "The formation of organic nitrates during the oxidation of the biogenic hydrocarbon isoprene can strongly affect boundary layer concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2). We constrain uncertainties in the chemistry of these isoprene nitrates using chemical transport model simulations in conjunction with observations over the eastern United States from the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) field campaign during summer 2004. The model best captures the observed boundary layer concentrations of organic nitrates and their correlation with ozone using a 4\% yield of isoprene nitrate production from the reaction of isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO, a recycling of 40\% NOx when isoprene nitrates react with OH and ozone, and a fast dry deposition rate of isoprene nitrates. Simulated boundary layer concentrations are only weakly sensitive to the rate of photochemical loss of the isoprene nitrates. An 8\% yield of isoprene nitrates degrades agreement with the observations somewhat, but concentrations are still within 50\% of observations and thus cannot be ruled out by this study. Our results indicate that complete recycling of NOx from the reactions of isoprene nitrates and slow rates of isoprene nitrate deposition are incompatible with the observations. We find that 50\% of the isoprene nitrate production in the model occurs via reactions of isoprene (or its oxidation products) with the NO3 radical, but note that the isoprene nitrate yield from this pathway is highly uncertain. Using recent estimates of rapid reaction rates with ozone, 20--24\% of isoprene nitrates are lost via this pathway, implying that ozonolysis is an important loss process for isoprene nitrates. Isoprene nitrates are shown to have a major impact on the nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) budget in the summertime U.S. continental boundary layer, consuming 15--19\% of the emitted NOx, of which 4--6\% is recycled back to NOx and the remainder is exported as isoprene nitrates (2--3\%) or deposited (8--10\%). Our constraints on reaction rates, branching ratios, and deposition rates need to be confirmed through further laboratory and field measurements. The model systematically underestimates free tropospheric concentrations of organic nitrates, indicating a need for future investigation of the processes controlling the observed distribution.",

On the other hand, emission inventories usually report only total non-methane VOC (NMVOC), but not a subdivision into these classes. Thus, VOC species profiles are needed that resolve total NMVOC emission data. The objective of this publication is to present the results of a compilation of VOC species profiles that dissolve total VOC into single-species profiles for all relevant anthropogenic emission source categories and the European situation. As in atmospheric dispersion models usually modules for generating biogenic emissions are directly included, only anthropogenic emissions are addressed. VOC species profiles for 87 emission source categories have been developed. The underlying data base can be used to generate the data for all chemical mechanisms. The species profiles have been generated using recent measurements and studies on VOC species resolution and thus represent the current state of knowledge in this area. The results can be used to create input data for atmospheric dispersion models in Europe. The profiles, especially those for solvent use, still show large uncertainties. There is still an enormous need for further measurements to achieve an improved species resolution. In addition, the solvent use directive and the DECOPAINT directive of the European Commission will result in a change of the composition of paints; more water-based and highsolid paints will be used; thus the species resolution will change drastically in the next years.

Accurate representation of O3 production chemistry is vital for effective predictions. In this study, VOC degradation chemistry in simplified mechanisms is compared to that in the near-explicit MCM mechanism using a boxmodel and by 'tagging' all organic degradation products over multi-day runs, thus calculating the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) for a selection of VOC representative of urban airmasses. Simplified mechanisms that aggregate VOC degradation products instead of aggregating emitted VOC produce comparable amounts of O3 from VOC degradation to the MCM. First day TOPP values are similar across mechanisms for most VOC, with larger discrepancies arising over the course of the model run. Aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic VOC have largest inter-mechanisms differences on the first day, while alkanes show largest differences on the second day. Simplified mechanisms break down VOC into smaller sized degradation products on the first day faster than the MCM impacting the total amount of O3 produced on subsequent days due to secondary chemistry.",

	abstract = "Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are known to cause damages to human health via two main pathways, viz. the direct toxic effects exerted by certain substances (termed here human toxicity) and their indirect effects related to photochemical ozone formation (POF). To comprehensively assess the damages at national level and thus define adequate air pollution abatement policies, substance breakdowns are needed. However, these are not readily available as total NMVOC emissions are only reported at sector level. In this study, we developed a reproducible methodology that combines available speciation profiles, i.e. distributions of substances emitted per type of sources, and sectoral NMVOC information to reach country-specific, substance-specific emission profiles. Annual emission inventories, including 270 single substances and 52 unrefined groups of substances, were determined for 31 European countries within the period 2000--2010. Using life cycle impact assessment methods for POF and human toxicity, impacts on human health were quantified. The results indicated that a strong linear correlation exists between POF impacts and the total NMVOC emissions, suggesting that air pollution abatement policies could use total NMVOC emissions as a proxy for reducing these impacts. Despite underlying uncertainties, the results also demonstrated that the POF impacts from NMVOC are negligible compared to their direct toxic impacts. The analysis of the results revealed that the toxic impacts (i) are caused by few substances, such as formaldehyde, acrolein and furan, (ii) primarily stem from transportation sectors and from residential sources, and (iii) are found not to correlate with total NMVOC emissions. Our findings therefore suggest the need for supporting air pollution abatement strategies with comprehensive impact assessments, which, in addition to complementing emission- and concentration-based indicators, should allow identifying country-specific improvement potentials at substance and sector levels.",

Two independent methods that take into account the effect of chemistry were used to determine the emission ratios of anthropogenic VOCs (including anthropogenic isoprene and oxygenated VOCs) over carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene. Emission ratios from both methods agree within ±20\%, showing the reliability of our approach. Emission ratios for alkenes, alkanes, and benzene are fairly similar between Los Angeles and Paris, whereas the emission ratios for C7--C9 aromatics in Paris are higher than in Los Angeles and other French and European Union urban areas by a factor of 2--3. The results suggest that the emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles still dominate the hydrocarbon distribution in northern mid-latitude urban areas, which disagrees with emission inventories. However, regional characteristics like the gasoline composition could affect the composition of hydrocarbon emissions. The observed emission ratios show large discrepancies by a factor of 2--4 (alkanes and oxygenated VOC) with the ones derived from four reference emission databases. A bias in CO emissions was also evident for both megacities. Nevertheless, the difference between measurements and inventory in terms of the overall OH reactivity is, in general, lower than 40\%, and the potential to form secondary organic aerosols (SOA) agrees within 30\% when considering volatile organic emissions as the main SOA precursors.",

	abstract = "Continuous measurements of a wide range of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) have been performed since 2001 in Paris megacity and three French medium-sized cities (Grenoble, Marseille, and Strasbourg). After a careful verification of the data measured, the ambient concentrations are used to analyze the spatial and seasonal variability of the anthropogenic NMHC and determine the present NMHC emission ratios relative to acetylene, a useful metric to evaluate and constraint emission inventories. We show that NMHC urban composition is consistent between all cities with no industrial influence and characteristic of the urban emission mixtures, which are mostly dominated by vehicle exhaust emissions. In winter, the urban NMHC composition generally shows an enhancement in combustion-derived products (alkenes, acetylene), C2--C3 alkanes and benzene, which presumes seasonal changes in emission ratio values. Present emission ratios of NMHC relative to acetylene are determined in Paris and Strasbourg both in summer and winter. They generally compare within a factor of two except for C7--C9 aromatics in Paris. On a seasonal basis, summertime emission ratios are three times higher than wintertime ones while they stay constant for combustion derived product (alkenes) and benzene. The unburned gasoline fraction (alkanes and C7--C9 aromatics) shows the maximum difference up to a factor of seven. These findings suggest that the emission ratios reflect seasonal changes in emissions and can be a useful metric to constraint temporally resolved emission inventories at different time of the year.",

Measurement results on a chassis dynamometer were used to determine VOC profiles for exhaust gas emissions of passenger cars for different vehicle and fuel types and different driving modes. Further measurements resulted in emission factors and VOC profiles for lignite burning in residential stoves. Using remote sensing techniques benzene emission factors of gas stations and the efficiency of gasoline vapour recovery systems were measured.To improve the quality and the spatial and temporal resolution of emission data, emission models were improved or modified. This was done by elaborating and applying new methods for important emission source categories (e.g., solvent use, road traffic, small combustion) as well as including new data sources in the calculation routines (e.g. emission statements, land use data, import/export indices of solvents). Simultaneously considerable progress was made improving temporal and spatial allocation functions and VOC profiles. With these improvements a large number of anthropogenic emission data sets for 14 different grid projections in Germany and Europe have been generated. An emission scenario for Germany for 2010 suggests that considering air quality directives from the EU and Germany which are in force or in pipeline, German emissions of VOC and NOx will decrease, but still exceed the national emission ceilings of the EU-NEC directive.",

Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model.

The emission ratios of VOCs relative to CO and acetylene were calculated using a method in which the ratio of a VOC with acetylene is plotted versus the photochemical age. The intercept at the photochemical age of zero gives the emission ratio. The so determined emission ratios were compared to other measurement sets, including data from the same location in 2002, canister samples collected inside New York City and Boston, aircraft measurements from Los Angeles in 2002, and the average urban composition of 39 U.S. cities. All the measurements generally agree within a factor of two. The measured emission ratios also agree for most compounds within a factor of two with vehicle exhaust data indicating that a major source of VOCs in urban areas is automobiles. A comparison with an anthropogenic emission database shows less agreement. Especially large discrepancies were found for the C2-C4 alkanes and most oxygenated species. As an example, the database overestimated toluene by almost a factor of three, which caused an air quality forecast model (WRF-CHEM) using this database to overpredict the toluene mixing ratio by a factor of 2.5 as well. On the other hand, the overall reactivity of the measured species and the reactivity of the same compounds in the emission database were found to agree within 30\%.",

	abstract = "Several different inventories of global and regional anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are assessed for the 1980--2010 period. The species considered in this study are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and black carbon. The inventories considered include the ACCMIP historical emissions developed in support of the simulations for the IPCC AR5 assessment. Emissions for 2005 and 2010 from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are also included. Large discrepancies between the global and regional emissions are identified, which shows that there is still no consensus on the best estimates for surface emissions of atmospheric compounds. At the global scale, anthropogenic emissions of CO, NOx and SO2 show the best agreement for most years, although agreement does not necessarily mean that uncertainty is low. The agreement is low for BC emissions, particularly in the period prior to 2000. The best consensus is for NOx emissions for all periods and all regions, except for China, where emissions in 1980 and 1990 need to be better defined. Emissions of CO need better quantification in the USA and India for all periods; in Central Europe, the evolution of emissions during the past two decades needs to be better determined. The agreement between the different SO2 emissions datasets is rather good for the USA, but better quantification is needed elsewhere, particularly for Central Europe, India and China. The comparisons performed in this study show that the use of RCP8.5 for the extension of the ACCMIP inventory beyond 2000 is reasonable, until more global or regional estimates become available. Concerning biomass burning emissions, most inventories agree within 50--80\%, depending on the year and season. The large differences between biomass burning inventories are due to differences in the estimates of burned areas from the different available products, as well as in the amount of biomass burned.",

Although mainly developed by the air quality modelling community, these models are also of interest for numerical weather prediction and regional climate modelling as they can consider not only the effects of meteorology on air quality, but also the potentially important effects of atmospheric composition on weather. Two ways of online coupling can be distinguished: online integrated and online access coupling. Online integrated models simulate meteorology and chemistry over the same grid in one model using one main time step for integration. Online access models use independent meteorology and chemistry modules that might even have different grids, but exchange meteorology and chemistry data on a regular and frequent basis. This article offers a comprehensive review of the current research status of online coupled meteorology and atmospheric chemistry modelling within Europe. Eighteen regional online coupled models developed or being used in Europe are described and compared. Topics discussed include a survey of processes relevant to the interactions between atmospheric physics, dynamics and composition; a brief overview of existing online mesoscale models and European model developments; an analysis on how feedback processes are treated in these models; numerical issues associated with coupled models; and several case studies and model performance evaluation methods. Finally, this article highlights selected scientific issues and emerging challenges that require proper consideration to improve the reliability and usability of these models for the three scientific communities: air quality, numerical meteorology modelling (including weather prediction) and climate modelling. This review will be of particular interest to model developers and users in all three fields as it presents a synthesis of scientific progress and provides recommendations for future research directions and priorities in the development, application and evaluation of online coupled models.",

In this study, nested WRF-Chem simulations with a finest grid resolution of 1 km are conducted to investigate ozone concentrations [O 3 ] due to urbanization within cities in arid/semi-arid environments. First, a method based on a shape preserving Monotonic Cubic Interpolation (MCI) is developed and used to downscale anthropogenic emissions from the 4 km resolution 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI05) to the finest model resolution of 1 km. Using the rapidly expanding Phoenix metropolitan region as the area of focus, we demonstrate the proposed MCI method achieves ozone simulation results with appreciably improved correspondence to observations relative to the default interpolation method of the WRF-Chem system. Next, two additional sets of experiments are conducted, with the recommended MCI approach, to examine impacts of urbanization on ozone production: (1) the urban land cover is included (i.e., urbanization experiments) and, (2) the urban land cover is replaced with the region{\rq}s native shrubland. Impacts due to the presence of the built environment on [O 3 ] are highly heterogeneous across the metropolitan area. Increased near surface [O 3 ] due to urbanization of 10--20 ppb is predominantly a nighttime phenomenon while simulated impacts during daytime are negligible. Urbanization narrows the daily [O 3 ] range (by virtue of increasing nighttime minima), an impact largely due to the region{\rq}s urban heat island.

	abstract = "Recent increases in oil and natural gas (NG) production throughout the western US have come with scientific and public interest in emission rates, air quality and climate impacts related to this industry. This study uses a regional-scale air quality model (WRF-Chem) to simulate high ozone (O3) episodes during the winter of 2013 over the Uinta Basin (UB) in northeastern Utah, which is densely populated by thousands of oil and NG wells. The high-resolution meteorological simulations are able qualitatively to reproduce the wintertime cold pool conditions that occurred in 2013, allowing the model to reproduce the observed multi-day buildup of atmospheric pollutants and the accompanying rapid photochemical ozone formation in the UB. Two different emission scenarios for the oil and NG sector were employed in this study. The first emission scenario (bottom-up) was based on the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emission Inventory (NEI) (2011, version 1) for the oil and NG sector for the UB. The second emission scenario (top-down) was based on estimates of methane (CH4) emissions derived from in situ aircraft measurements and a regression analysis for multiple species relative to CH4 concentration measurements in the UB. Evaluation of the model results shows greater underestimates of CH4 and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the simulation with the NEI-2011 inventory than in the case when the top-down emission scenario was used. Unlike VOCs, the NEI-2011 inventory significantly overestimates the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), while the top-down emission scenario results in a moderate negative bias. The model simulation using the top-down emission case captures the buildup and afternoon peaks observed during high O3 episodes. In contrast, the simulation using the bottom-up inventory is not able to reproduce any of the observed high O3 concentrations in the UB. Simple emission reduction scenarios show that O3 production is VOC sensitive and NOx insensitive within the UB. The model results show a disproportionate contribution of aromatic VOCs to O3 formation relative to all other VOC emissions. The model analysis reveals that the major factors driving high wintertime O3 in the UB are shallow boundary layers with light winds, high emissions of VOCs from oil and NG operations compared to NOx emissions, enhancement of photolysis fluxes and reduction of O3 loss from deposition due to snow cover.",

	abstract = "Abstract Nighttime concentrations of the gas phase nitrate radical (NO3) were successfully measured during a four week field campaign in an arid urban location, Reno Nevada, using long-path Differential Optical Absorbance Spectrometry (DOAS). While typical concentrations of NO3 ranged from 5 to 20 ppt, elevated concentrations were observed during a wildfire event. Horizontal mixing in the free troposphere was considerable because the sampling site was above the stable nocturnal boundary layer every night and this justified a box modeling approach. Process analysis of box model simulations showed NO3 accounted for approximately half of the loss of internal olefins, 60\% of the isoprene loss, and 85\% of the $\alpha$-pinene loss during the nighttime hours during a typical night of the field study. The NO3 + aldehyde reactions were not as important as anticipated. On a polluted night impacted by wildfires upwind of the sampling location, NO3 reactions were more important.

	abstract = "Abstract The seasonal and inter-annual variations of ozone (O3) in the atmospheric boundary layer of the Asia-Pacific Ocean were investigated using model simulations (2001--2007) from the Model of Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART-4). The simulated O3 and diagnostic precipitation are in good agreement with the observations. Model results suggest that the Asia-Pacific monsoon significantly influences the seasonal and inter-annual variations of ozone. The differences of anthropogenic emissions and zonal winds in meridional directions cause a pollutants' transition zone at approximately 20--30 N. The onset of summer monsoons with a northward migration of the rain belt leads the transition zone to drift north, eventually causing a summer minimum of ozone to the north of 30N. In years with an early onset of summer monsoons, strong inflows of clean oceanic air lead to low ozone at polluted oceanic sites near the continent, while strong outflows from the continent exist, resulting in high levels of O3 over remote portions of the Asia-Pacific Ocean. The reverse is true in years when the summer monsoon onset is late.",

	abstract = "Isoprene is important in atmospheric chemistry, but its seasonal emission pattern -- especially in the tropics, where most isoprene is emitted -- is incompletely understood. We set out to discover generalized relationships applicable across many biomes between large-scale isoprene emission and a series of potential predictor variables, including both observed and model-estimated variables related to gross primary production (GPP) and canopy temperature. We used remotely sensed atmospheric concentrations of formaldehyde, an intermediate oxidation product of isoprene, as a proxy for isoprene emission in 22 regions selected to span high to low latitudes, to sample major biomes, and to minimize interference from pyrogenic sources of volatile organic compounds that could interfere with the isoprene signal. Formaldehyde concentrations showed the highest average seasonal correlations with remotely sensed (r = 0.85) and model-estimated (r = 0.80) canopy temperatures. Both variables predicted formaldehyde concentrations better than air temperature (r= 0.56) and a 'reference' isoprene model that combines GPP and an exponential function of temperature (r = 0.49), and far better than either remotely sensed green vegetation cover, fPAR (r = 0.25) or model-estimated GPP (r = 0.14). Gross primary production in tropical regions was anti-correlated with formaldehyde concentration (r = −0.30), which peaks during the dry season. Our results were most reliable in the tropics, where formaldehyde observational errors were the least. The tropics are of particular interest because they are the greatest source of isoprene emission as well as the region where previous modelling attempts have been least successful. We conjecture that positive correlations of isoprene emission with GPP and air temperature (as found in temperate forests) may arise simply because both covary with canopy temperature, peaking during the relatively short growing season. The lack of a general correlation between GPP and formaldehyde concentration in the seasonal cycle is consistent with experimental evidence that isoprene emission rates are largely decoupled from photosynthetic rates, and with the likely adaptive significance of isoprene emission in protecting leaves against heat damage and oxidative stress.",

Stratosphere--troposphere exchange gave rise to between 3 and 5 ppb across Europe, whereas the mid-latitudes of the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Ocean region contributed 6--8 ppb. Surface ozone levels of 10--16 ppb were associated with the mid-latitudes of North America and the North Atlantic Ocean regions. Appreciable intercontinental ozone production occurred downwind of continental regions and above the surface layer. Intercontinental ozone formation and transport from tropical regions contributed about 4 ppb and was much less efficient compared with that from mid-latitudes. There were approaching 60 chemical processes driving intercontinental ozone formation, of which the HO2 + NO, CH3O2 + NO and CH3COO2 + NO reactions were the most important. Ozone production appeared to be driven by OH oxidation of secondary reaction products rather than the oxidation of primary emitted VOCs. The largest intercontinental ozone contributions amounted to about 20 ppb from North America to European baseline stations, 14 ppb from Asia to North American baseline stations and 10 ppb from Asia to European baseline stations. It is possible that changing intercontinental ozone production and transport could have led to seasonal ozone trends and shifts in seasonal cycles at northern hemisphere mid-latitude baseline ozone monitoring stations.",

The PIM was applied to a simulation of O3 formation in July 2030 in the U.S., using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions and assuming advanced controls on light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and other sources. The PIM determines the source contributions by integrating first-order sensitivity coefficients over a range of emissions, a path, from the background case to the base case. There are many potential paths, with each representing a specific emission-control strategy leading to zero anthropogenic emissions, i.e., controlling all sources together versus controlling some source(s) preferentially are different paths. Three paths were considered, and the O3, formaldehyde, and NO2 anthropogenic increments were apportioned to five source categories. At rural and urban sites in the eastern U.S. and for all three paths, point sources typically have the largest contribution to the O3 and NO2 anthropogenic increments, and either LDVs or area sources, the smallest.

The MCM v3 mechanisms for both isoprene and butane generally performed well and were found to provide an acceptable reaction framework for describing the NOx-photo-oxidation experiments on the above systems, although a number of parameter modifications and refinements were identified which resulted in an improved performance. All these relate to the magnitude of sources of free radicals from organic chemical process, such as carbonyl photolysis rates and the yields of radicals from the reactions of O3 with unsaturated oxygenates, and specific recommendations are made for refinements. In addition to this, it was necessary to include a representation of the reactions of O(3P) with isoprene, MACR and MVK (which were not previously treated in MCM v3), and conclusions are drawn concerning the required extent of free radical formation from these reactions.

This involved developing a unified chemical classification system, assigning compounds to mixtures, assigning model species for the mechanisms to the compounds, and making assignments for unknown, unassigned, and nonvolatile mass. The comprehensiveness of the assignments, the contributions of various types of speciation categories to current profile and total emissions data, inconsistencies with existing undocumented model species assignments, and remaining speciation issues and areas of needed work, are also discussed.

IMPLICATIONSAssigning air quality model species to the hundreds of emitted chemicals is a necessary link between emissions data and modeling effects of emissions on air quality. This is not easy and makes it difficult to implement new and more chemically detailed mechanisms in models. If done incorrectly, it is similar to errors in emissions speciation or the chemical mechanism used. Nevertheless, making such assignments is often as an afterthought in chemical mechanism development and emissions processing, and existing assignments are usually undocumented and have errors and inconsistencies.

One of the largest conurbations in Sub-Saharan Africa is developed around the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria (Jhb-Pta megacity). In this study, a photochemical box model with a detailed representation of ozone (O3) formation chemistry was used to investigate the state of current air quality and photochemical processes in the Jhb-Pta megacity, as well as scenarios that could possibly mitigate air pollution. Results indicated that the Jhb-Pta megacity is within a VOC-limited (or NOx-saturated) regime. Major sources of NOx include transport from the Mpumalanga Highveld and local traffic emissions. O3 levels in the Jhb-Pta megacity will be more effectively reduced if VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions are decreased. A reduction of NOx emissions leads to an increase in O3 because of a decrease in titration through the reaction with NO. The same effect was observed in various cities worldwide where O3 levels increased when NOx emissions were reduced during emission control strategies. The effect of reducing vehicular emissions in the Jhb-Pta megacity on the production of O3 was also investigated. A significant increase of approximately 23 ppb O3 was observed when emissions of VOCs, NOx and CO were reduced by changing from Euro-0 to Euro-3 vehicles. It is therefore recommended that VOC emissions are decreased together with the implementation of Euro-3 and cleaner vehicles in the future."

During this period, photochemistry enhanced by the stagnant meteorological conditions and concentrated VOCs led to high ozone mixing ratios (150 ppbv). A simple analysis of aromatic VOCs measured by proton-transfer-reaction mass-spectrometry (PTR-MS) is used to estimate (1) VOC emission ratios (the ratio of two VOCs at the time of emission) relative to benzene, (2) aromatic VOC emission rates, and (3) ambient OH radical concentrations. These quantities are determined from a best fit to VOC : benzene ratios as a function of time. The main findings are that (1) emission ratios are consistent with contributions from both oil and gas producing wells; (2) the emission rate of methane (27--57 × 103 kg methane h−1), extrapolated from the emission rate of benzene (4.1 $\plusminus$ 0.4 × 105 molecules cm−3 s−1), agrees with an independent estimate of methane emissions from aircraft measurements in 2012; and (3) calculated daily OH concentrations are low, peaking at 1 × 106 molecules cm−3, and are consistent with Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) modeling. The analysis is extended to photochemical production of oxygenated VOCs measured by PTR-MS and is able to explain daytime variability of these species. It is not able to completely reproduce nighttime behavior, possibly due to surface deposition. Using results from this analysis, the carbon mass of secondary compounds expected to have formed by the sixth day of the stagnation event was calculated, then compared to the measured mass of primary and secondary compounds. Only 17\% of the expected secondary carbon mass is accounted for by gas phase, aerosol, and snow organic carbon measurements. The disparity is likely due to substantial amounts of unquantified oxygenated products.",

Measurements of non-methane hydrocarbons are available for the summers of 2001--2003 at three of these sites and NOx at six of these sites for the full time period. This routine monitoring data is complemented by data sets of ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations obtained in the summers of 2001 and 2003 at three sites in the region and comprehensive measurements of VOC reactivity at two sites in 2001. Daytime concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) are approximately 35\% lower on weekends at all the sites, whereas the VOC reactivity changes by less than 10\%. All six sites in the Sacramento Valley have higher 8-h maximum average ozone on the weekend and are more likely to exceed the national standard of 85 ppb on the weekend. In contrast, all the sites in the Mountain Counties are less likely to exceed the federal ozone standard on the weekend. Analysis of the day-of-week trends in odd oxygen show that the weekend effect of ozone within Sacramento is strongly influenced by NO sources close to the monitoring sites. This suggests that ozone measurements from monitoring sites close to highways, including two rural locations, may not be representative of the regional abundance, and lead to underestimates of long term exposure for humans and ecosystems.",

Here we use an observation-based method to quantify net ozone (O3) production rates in the outflow from the Sacramento metropolitan region and examine the O3 decrease resulting from reductions in NOx emissions. This observational method does not rely on assumptions about detailed chemistry of ozone production, rather it is an independent means to verify and test these assumptions. We use an instantaneous steady-state model as well as a detailed 1-D plume model to aid in interpretation of the ozone production inferred from observations. In agreement with the models, the observations show that early in the plume, the NOx dependence for Ox (Ox = O3 + NO2) production is strongly coupled with temperature, suggesting that temperature-dependent biogenic VOC emissions and other temperature-related effects can drive Ox production between NOx-limited and NOx-suppressed regimes. As a result, NOx reductions were found to be most effective at higher temperatures over the 7 year period. We show that violations of the California 1-h O3 standard (90 ppb) in the region have been decreasing linearly with decreases in NOx (at a given temperature) and predict that reductions of NOx concentrations (and presumably emissions) by an additional 30 \% (relative to 2007 levels) will eliminate violations of the state 1 h standard in the region. If current trends continue, a 30 \% decrease in NOx is expected by 2012, and an end to violations of the 1 h standard in the Sacramento region appears to be imminent.",

Urban and polluted rural environments are explored with a regional simulation derived from a specific episode in the midwestern United States. The simulations predict that O3 increases with temperature in both urban and polluted rural environments. The O3-temperature relation is driven largely by chemistry of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) which represents an increased sink for both NOx and odd hydrogen at low temperatures. Isoprene emissions, H2O, and solar radiation also contribute to the O3-temperature relation. Possible correlations between temperature and anthropogenic emissions or stagnant meteorology were not included. Observations at urban and rural sites in the United States suggests that O3 increases with temperature at a faster rate than the models predict. Calculations with a one-dimensional global model suggest that increased temperature in the polluted boundary layer does not lead to increased O3 in the free troposphere, because increased export of O3 is balanced by decreased export of odd nitrogen species.",

Climatic changes expected for temperature, atmospheric water vapor, and biogenic VOC emissions each individually cause a 1--5\% increase in the daily peak ozone. Projected reductions in anthropogenic emissions of 10--50\% in NOx and 50--70\% in VOCs and CO have the greatest single effect, reducing ozone by 8--15\% in urban areas. Changes to the chemical boundary conditions lead to ozone increases of 6\% in the San Francisco Bay area and along the west coast but only 1--2\% inland. Simulations combining climate effects predict that ozone will increase 3--10\% in various regions of California. This increase is partly offset by projected future emissions reductions, and a combined climate and emissions simulation yields ozone reductions of 3--9\% in the Central Valley and almost no net change in the San Francisco Bay area. We find that different portions of the model domain have widely varying sensitivity to climate parameters. In particular, the San Francisco Bay region is more strongly influenced by temperature changes than inland regions, indicating that air quality in this region may worsen under future climate regimes.",

	abstract = "We present a largely tutorial overview of the main processes that influence the photochemistry of the background troposphere. This is mostly driven by the photolysis of ozone by solar ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than about 340 nm, resulting in production of excited O(1D) atoms, whose reaction with water vapor produces OH radicals. In the background atmosphere the OH radicals mostly react with CO, and with CH4 and some of its oxidation products, which in turn are oxidized by OH. Depending on the availability of NOx catalysts, ozone may be produced or destroyed in amounts that are much greater than the downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere. Using the 3D chemical-transport model MATCH, global distributions and budget analyses are presented for tropospheric O3, CH4, CO, and the ``odd hydrogen'' compounds OH, HO2 and H2O2. We show that OH is present in maximum concentrations in the tropics, and that most of the chemical breakdown of CO and CH4 also occurs in equatorial regions. We also split the troposphere into continental and marine regions, and show that there is a tremendous difference in photochemical O3 and OH production for these regions, much larger than the difference between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. Finally, we show the results from a numerical simulation in which we reduced the amount of ozone in the model stratosphere by a factor of 10 (which in turn reduced the flux of O3 into the troposphere by about the same factor). Nevertheless, for summer conditions, model calculated O3 mixing ratios below 5 km in the mid to high latitudes were about 70--90\% as high as those calculated with the full downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere. This indicates that, at least under these conditions, O3 concentrations in the lower troposphere are largely controlled by in situ photochemistry, with only a secondary influence from stratospheric influx.",

@article{Monks:2015,
	abstract = "Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone--climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric scales. New observational opportunities are offered both by satellites and small sensors that bridge the scales.",

In the past decade, high concentrations of HCHO and CHOCHO have been observed for the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in southern China. In this study, we performed box model simulations of HCHO and CHOCHO at a semi-rural site in the PRD, focusing on understanding their sources and sinks and factors influencing the CHOCHO to HCHO ratio (RGF). The model was constrained by the simultaneous measurements of trace gases and radicals. Isoprene oxidation by OH radicals is the major pathway forming HCHO, followed by degradations of alkenes, aromatics, and alkanes. The production of CHOCHO is dominated by isoprene and aromatic degradation; contributions from other NMHCs are of minor importance. Compared to the measurement results, the model predicts significant higher HCHO and CHOCHO concentrations. Sensitivity studies suggest that fresh emissions of precursor VOCs, uptake of HCHO and CHOCHO by aerosols, fast vertical transport, and uncertainties in the treatment of dry deposition all have the potential to contribute significantly to this discrepancy. Our study indicates that, in addition to chemical considerations (i.e., VOC composition, OH and NOx levels), atmospheric physical processes (e.g., transport, dilution, deposition) make it difficult to use the CHOCHO to HCHO ratio as an indicator for the origin of air mass composition.",

    abstract = "As a major source region of the hydroxyl radical OH, the Tropics largely control the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere on a global scale. However, emissions of hydrocarbons from the tropical rainforest that react rapidly with OH can potentially deplete the amount of OH and thereby reduce the oxidation capacity. The airborne GABRIEL field campaign in equatorial South America (Suriname) in October 2005 investigated the influence of the tropical rainforest on the HOx budget (HOx = OH + HO2). The first observations of OH and HO2 over a tropical rainforest are compared to steady state concentrations calculated with the atmospheric chemistry box model MECCA. The important precursors and sinks for HOx chemistry, measured during the campaign, are used as constraining parameters for the simulation of OH and HO2. Significant underestimations of HOx are found by the model over land during the afternoon, with mean ratios of observation to model of 12.2 $\plusminus$ 3.5 and 4.1 $\plusminus$ 1.4 for OH and HO2, respectively. The discrepancy between measurements and simulation results is correlated to the abundance of isoprene. While for low isoprene mixing ratios (above ocean or at altitudes $\gt$3 km), observation and simulation agree fairly well, for mixing ratios $\gt$200 pptV ($\lt$3 km over the rainforest) the model tends to underestimate the HOx observations as a function of isoprene. Box model simulations have been performed with the condensed chemical mechanism of MECCA and with the detailed isoprene reaction scheme of MCM, resulting in similar results for HOx concentrations. Simulations with constrained HO2 concentrations show that the conversion from HO2 to OH in the model is too low. However, by neglecting the isoprene chemistry in the model, observations and simulations agree much better. An OH source similar to the strength of the OH sink via isoprene chemistry is needed in the model to resolve the discrepancy. A possible explanation is that the oxidation of isoprene by OH not only dominates the removal of OH but also produces it in a similar amount. Several additional reactions which directly produce OH have been implemented into the box model, suggesting that upper limits in producing OH are still not able to reproduce the observations (improvement by factors of $\approx$2.4 and $\approx$2 for OH and HO2, respectively). We determine that OH has to be recycled to 94\% instead of the simulated 38\% to match the observations, which is most likely to happen in the isoprene degradation process, otherwise additional sources are required.",

To study gas- and aqueous-phase reaction kinetics and speciation of mercury during AMDEs, we have included mercury chemistry into the box model MECCA (Module Efficiently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere), which enables dynamic simulation of bromine activation and ODEs. We found that the reaction of Hg with Br atoms dominates the loss of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). To explain the experimentally observed synchronous depletion of GEM and O3, the reaction rate of Hg+BrO has to be much lower than that of Hg+Br. The synchronicity is best reproduced with rate coefficients at the lower limit of the literature values for both reactions, i.e. kHg+Br=3×10−13 and kHg+BrO 1×10−15 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. Throughout the simulated AMDEs, (BrHgOBr) was the most abundant reactive mercury species, both in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase. The aqueous-phase concentrations of BrHgOBr, HgBr2, and HgCl2 were several orders of magnitude larger than that of Hg(SO3)22−. Considering chlorine chemistry outside depletion events (i.e. without bromine activation), the concentration of total divalent mercury in sea-salt aerosol particles (mostly HgCl42−) was much higher than in dilute aqueous droplets (mostly Hg(SO3)22−), and did not exhibit a diurnal cycle (no correlation with HO2 radicals).",

A sensitivity study of SQT and MT emission factors and algorithm parameters was conducted by assigning values to four plant functional types (PFTs) using both recent measurements and literature values. The standard deviations of the emissions factors within these PFTs were two to four times the averages because of the variation in experimental basal emissions rate data. More recently published SQT and MT basal emission rates are generally lower than those reported in the literature through 2004. With the new emissions factors, monthly average SQT emission rates for the contiguous United States are equal to 16\% of the MT emissions during July and 9\% of the emissions during January. The SQT emissions distribution is strongly influenced by the grass and crop PFT, for which SQT emissions data are quite limited. }

Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with 1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is 600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.",

This uncertainty affects the design of control strategies to reduce tropospheric O3 production. The effect of controlling ozone precursors on sensitivity regimes was evaluated by performing simulations with MM5-EMICAT2000-CMAQ model to represent O3 formation in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula with baseline emission rates for VOC and NOx, and reducing anthropogenic VOC and NOx emissions on a 35\%. Three different scenarios were considered in order to assess chemical sensitivity in urban, industrial, and background domains. Areas downwind of the city of Barcelona benefit from NOx reductions (reduction of 10 ppb in ground-level O3), while the same reduction causes an important increment of O3 in Barcelona (9 ppb) and the area downwind of Tarragona (18 ppb), with a high industrial influence. The city of Barcelona benefits from VOC reductions (10 ppb of O3) as well as the industrial zone of Alcover (20 ppb). The rest of the domain is practically insensitive to VOC reductions. Diverse photochemical species derived from the air quality model were used as indicators in order to establish the chemical sensitivity regime existing in the areas, analyzing whether O3 values reacted consistently to similar changes in emissions. Results showed that NOy (total reactive nitrogen) and O3/NOy are the indicators involving a lower uncertainty when assessing sensitivity, according to the narrow transition regime between NOx- and VOC-sensitive chemistry and the low uncertainty observed. Indicators performed better in VOC-sensitive than in NOx-sensitive domains. H2O2- and HNO3- derived indicators entailed higher uncertainties since transition regimes between NOx and VOC sensitivity covered a wide range. The extent of reaction also performed as a good indicator to separate NOx- and VOC-sensitive regimes. This sensitivity analysis provides a tool for establishing hypothetical control policies for O3 precursor emissions through a comparison of simulated correlation between the species.",

    abstract  ="Two coupled climate-chemistry model experiments for the period 1990-2030 were conducted: one with a fixed climate and the other with a varying climate forced by the is92a scenario. By comparing results from these experiments we have attempted to identify changes and variations in physical climate that may have important influences upon tropospheric chemical composition. Climate variables considered include: temperature{,} humidity{,} convective mass fluxes{,} precipitation{,} and the large-scale circulation. Increases in humidity{,} directly related to increases in temperature{,} exert a major influence on the budgets of ozone and the hydroxyl radical: decreasing O3 and increasing OH. Warming enhances decomposition of PAN{,} releasing NOx{,} and increases the rate of methane oxidation. Surface warming enhances vegetation emissions of isoprene{,} an important ozone precursor. In the changed climate{,} tropical convection generally reduces{,} but penetrates to higher levels. Over northern continents{,} convection tends to increase. These changes in convection affect both vertical mixing and lightning NOx emissions. We find no global trend in lightning emissions{,} but significant changes in its distribution. Changes in precipitation and the large-scale circulation are less important for composition{,} at least in these experiments. Higher levels of the oxidants OH and H2O2 lead to increases in aerosol formation and concentrations. These results indicate that climate-chemistry feedbacks are dominantly negative (less O3{,} a shorter CH4 lifetime{,} and more aerosol). The major mode of inter-annual variability in the is92a climate experiment is ENSO. This strongly modulates isoprene emissions from vegetation via tropical land surface temperatures. ENSO is also clearly the dominant source of variability in tropical column ozone{,} mainly through changes in the distribution of convection. The magnitude of inter-annual variability in ozone is comparable to the changes brought about by emissions and climate changes between the 1990s and 2020s{,} suggesting that it will be difficult to disentangle the different components of near-future changes."

Observations and numerical models show that UV-scattering particles in the boundary layer accelerate photochemical reactions and smog production, but UV-absorbing aerosols such as mineral dust and soot inhibit smog production.

    abstract = "Tropospheric O3 concentrations are functions of the chain lengths of NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) and HOx (HOx = OH + HO2 + RO2) radical catalytic cycles. For a fixed HOx source at low NOx concentrations, kinetic models indicate the rate of O3 production increases linearly with increases in NOx concentrations (NOx limited). At higher NOx concentrations, kinetic models predict ozone production rates decrease with increasing NOx (NOx saturated). We present observations of NO, NO2, O3, OH, HO2, H2CO, actinic flux, and temperature obtained during the 1999 Southern Oxidant Study from June 15 to July 15, 1999, at Cornelia Fort Airpark, Nashville, Tennessee. The observations are used to evaluate the instantaneous ozone production rate (PO3) as a function of NO abundances and the primary HOx production rate (PHOx). These observations provide quantitative evidence for the response of PO3 to NOx. For high PHOx (0.5 $\lt$ PHOx $\lt$ 0.7 ppt/s), O3 production at this site increases linearly with NO to 500 ppt. PO3 levels out in the range 500–1000 ppt NO and decreases for NO above 1000 ppt. An analysis along chemical coordinates indicates that models of chemistry controlling peroxy radical abundances, and consequently PO3, have a large error in the rate or product yield of the RO2 + HO2 reaction for the classes of RO2 that predominate in Nashville. Photochemical models and our measurements can be forced into agreement if the product of the branching ratio and rate constant for organic peroxide formation, via RO2 + HO2 → ROOH + O2, is reduced by a factor of 3–12. Alternatively, these peroxides could be rapidly photolyzed under atmospheric conditions making them at best a temporary HOx reservoir. This result implies that O3 production in or near urban areas with similar hydrocarbon reactivity and HOx production rates may be NOx saturated more often than current models suggest.",

The seasonal trends of O3 and NO2 recorded in this period have been studied. Furthermore, we used the data collected during one year (2005), to define the characteristics of a multiple linear regression model and a neural network model. Both models are used to model the hourly O3 concentration, using, two scenarios: 1) in the first as inputs, only meteorological parameters and 2) in the second adding photochemical parameters at those of the first scenario. In order to evaluate the performance of the model four statistical criteria are used: correlation coefficient, fractional bias, normalized mean squared error and a factor of two. All the criteria show that the neural network gives better results, compared to the regression model, in all the model scenarios. Predictions of O3 have been carried out by many authors using a feed forward neural architecture. In this paper we show that a recurrent architecture significantly improves the performances of neural predictors. Using only the meteorological parameters as input, the recurrent architecture shows performance better than the multiple linear regression model that uses meteorological and photochemical data as input, making the neural network model with recurrent architecture a more useful tool in areas where only weather measurements are available. Finally, we used the neural network model to forecast the O3 hourly concentrations 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h ahead. The performances of the model in predicting O3 levels are discussed. Emphasis is given to the possibility of using the neural network model in operational ways in areas where only meteorological data are available, in order to predict O3 also in sites where it has not been measured yet.

    abstract = "Emissions to air are reported by countries to EMEP. The emissions data are used for country compliance checking with EU emission ceilings and associated emission reductions. The emissions data are also necessary as input for air quality modelling. The quality of these 'official' emissions varies across Europe. As alternative to these official emissions, a spatially explicit high-resolution emission inventory (7 × 7 km) for UNECE-Europe for all years between 2003 and 2009 for the main air pollutants was made. The primary goal was to supply air quality modellers with the input they need. The inventory was constructed by using the reported emission national totals by sector where the quality is sufficient. The reported data were analysed by sector in detail, and completed with alternative emission estimates as needed. This resulted in a complete emission inventory for all countries. For particulate matter, for each source emissions have been split in coarse and fine particulate matter, and further disaggregated to EC, OC, SO4, Na and other minerals using fractions based on the literature. Doing this at the most detailed sectoral level in the database implies that a consistent set was obtained across Europe. This allows better comparisons with observational data which can, through feedback, help to further identify uncertain sources and/or support emission inventory improvements for this highly uncertain pollutant. The resulting emission data set was spatially distributed consistently across all countries by using proxy parameters. Point sources were spatially distributed using the specific location of the point source. The spatial distribution for the point sources was made year-specific. The TNO-MACC_II is an update of the TNO-MACC emission data set. Major updates included the time extension towards 2009, use of the latest available reported data (including updates and corrections made until early 2012) and updates in distribution maps.",

    abstract = "This paper highlights the development of the emission inventories and emission processing for Europe (EU) and North America (NA) in the second phase of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) project. The main purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to understand the importance of coupled meteorological-chemical models in our understanding of the feedback of chemistry on the meteorology. A second purpose of the second phase of the AQMEII project is to explore the differences between EU and NA in a dynamic evaluation of two modeling years (2006 and 2010). The first phase of AQMEII also considered the modeling year 2006. Comparing the two AQMEII phases, for the EU domain, there were substantial decreases in CO (−19\%), NH3 (−11\%), and SO2 (−12\%) emissions between the phase 2 and phase 1 emissions used for 2006. For the NA domain, there were decreases in CO (−10\%), non-methane hydrocarbons (−5\%), PM2.5 (−8\%), PM10 (−18\%), SO2 (−12\%), with an increase of 4\% in NOx. For the 2010 modeling year, 2009 emissions were used as a proxy for 2010 emissions in the EU domain. Between 2006 and 2009, considerable emission reductions were achieved for 17 EU countries, Norway and Switzerland as well as EU-Non-Member States, for all emitted species aside from NH3, which remained almost stable. Non-EU countries showed little change in emissions levels, though this may be a result of poor data quality. Shipping emissions decreased for PM and SO2 due to Sulfur Emission Control Areas on the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, while increasing for other species. Overall for the EU domain between 2006 and 2009, estimated NOx emissions decreased by 10\%, SO2 by 18\%, CO by 12\%, PM2.5 by 5\%, PM10 by 6\%, NMVOC by 11\%, and NH3 by 1\%. Between the 2006 and 2010 modeling years, estimated US NOx emissions decreased by 17\%, SO2 by 29\%, CO by 21\%, PM2.5 by 12\%, PM10 by 7\%, NMHC by 4\% and NH3 by 2\% while Canadian and Mexican emissions were assumed to remain constant. These changes in US emissions, however, only reflect changes in sectors for which we had year-specific information. In terms of natural emissions, climatic differences between 2006 and 2010 caused the European emissions of isoprene to peak earlier in the year 2006 than in 2010, and overall achieved higher levels in 2010. Biogenic emissions in North America increased in the east and decreased in the west between 2006 and 2010, due to regional temperature differences between the years from natural variation in solar radiation reaching the ground.

    abstract = "Air quality is strongly dependent on weather and is therefore sensitive to climate change. Recent studies have provided estimates of this climate effect through correlations of air quality with meteorological variables, perturbation analyses in chemical transport models (CTMs), and CTM simulations driven by general circulation model (GCM) simulations of 21st-century climate change. We review these different approaches and their results. The future climate is expected to be more stagnant, due to a weaker global circulation and a decreasing frequency of mid-latitude cyclones. The observed correlation between surface ozone and temperature in polluted regions points to a detrimental effect of warming. Coupled GCM–CTM studies find that climate change alone will increase summertime surface ozone in polluted regions by 1–10 ppb over the coming decades, with the largest effects in urban areas and during pollution episodes. This climate penalty means that stronger emission controls will be needed to meet a given air quality standard. Higher water vapor in the future climate is expected to decrease the ozone background, so that pollution and background ozone have opposite sensitivities to climate change. The effect of climate change on particulate matter (PM) is more complicated and uncertain than for ozone. Precipitation frequency and mixing depth are important driving factors but projections for these variables are often unreliable. GCM–CTM studies find that climate change will affect PM concentrations in polluted environments by ±0.1–1 μg m−3 over the coming decades. Wildfires fueled by climate change could become an increasingly important PM source. Major issues that should be addressed in future research include the ability of GCMs to simulate regional air pollution meteorology and its sensitivity to climate change, the response of natural emissions to climate change, and the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene. Research needs to be undertaken on the effect of climate change on mercury, particularly in view of the potential for a large increase in mercury soil emissions driven by increased respiration in boreal ecosystems.

    abstract={This paper provides a synthesis of results that have emerged from recent modeling studies of the potential sensitivity of U.S. regional ozone (O3) concentrations to global climate change (ca. 2050). This research has been carried out under the auspices of an ongoing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessment effort to increase scientific understanding of the multiple complex interactions among climate, emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and air quality. The ultimate goal is to enhance the ability of air quality managers to consider global change in their decisions through improved characterization of the potential effects of global change on air quality, including O3. The results discussed here are interim, representing the first phase of the EPA assessment. The aim in this first phase was to consider the effects of climate change alone on air quality, without accompanying changes in anthropogenic emissions of precursor pollutants. Across all of the modeling experiments carried out by the different groups, simulated global climate change causes increases of a few to several parts per billion (ppb) in summertime mean maximum daily 8-h average O3 concentrations over substantial regions of the country. The different modeling experiments in general do not, however, simulate the same regional patterns of change. These differences seem to result largely from variations in the simulated patterns of changes in key meteorological drivers, such as temperature and surface insolation. How isoprene nitrate chemistry is represented in the different modeling systems is an additional critical factor in the simulated O3 response to climate change.},

    abstract  ="Emissions of air pollutants and their precursors determine regional air quality and can alter climate. Climate change can perturb the long-range transport{,} chemical processing{,} and local meteorology that influence air pollution. We review the implications of projected changes in methane (CH4){,} ozone precursors (O3){,} and aerosols for climate (expressed in terms of the radiative forcing metric or changes in global surface temperature) and hemispheric-to-continental scale air quality. Reducing the O3 precursor CH4 would slow near-term warming by decreasing both CH4 and tropospheric O3. Uncertainty remains as to the net climate forcing from anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions{,} which increase tropospheric O3 (warming) but also increase aerosols and decrease CH4 (both cooling). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and non-CH4 volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) warm by increasing both O3 and CH4. Radiative impacts from secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are poorly understood. Black carbon emission controls{,} by reducing the absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere and on snow and ice{,} have the potential to slow near-term warming{,} but uncertainties in coincident emissions of reflective (cooling) aerosols and poorly constrained cloud indirect effects confound robust estimates of net climate impacts. Reducing sulfate and nitrate aerosols would improve air quality and lessen interference with the hydrologic cycle{,} but lead to warming. A holistic and balanced view is thus needed to assess how air pollution controls influence climate; a first step towards this goal involves estimating net climate impacts from individual emission sectors. Modeling and observational analyses suggest a warming climate degrades air quality (increasing surface O3 and particulate matter) in many populated regions{,} including during pollution episodes. Prior Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (SRES) allowed unconstrained growth{,} whereas the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios assume uniformly an aggressive reduction{,} of air pollutant emissions. New estimates from the current generation of chemistry-climate models with RCP emissions thus project improved air quality over the next century relative to those using the IPCC SRES scenarios. These two sets of projections likely bracket possible futures. We find that uncertainty in emission-driven changes in air quality is generally greater than uncertainty in climate-driven changes. Confidence in air quality projections is limited by the reliability of anthropogenic emission trajectories and the uncertainties in regional climate responses{,} feedbacks with the terrestrial biosphere{,} and oxidation pathways affecting O3 and SOA."

The simulation period consists of July 12–21, 2001, during which an ozone episode occurred over the Southeast. The ozone metrics used include daily maximum 8 h average O3 concentration and number of grid cells exceeding the US EPA ambient air-quality standard. The meteorological factor that had the largest impact on both ozone metrics was temperature, which increased daily maximum 8 h average O3 by 0.34 ppb K−1 on average over the simulation domain. Absolute humidity had a smaller but appreciable effect on daily maximum 8 h average O3 (−0.025 ppb for each percent increase in absolute humidity). While domain-average responses to changes in wind speed, mixing height, cloud liquid water content, and optical depth were rather small, these factors did have appreciable local effects in many areas. Temperature also had the largest effect on air-quality standard exceedances; a 2.5 K temperature increase led to a 30\% increase in the area exceeding the EPA standard.

The formula takes into account the most important processes occurring within the atmosphere, namely, scattering by molecules and aerosols and absorption by water vapor, ozone, and aerosols. These processes are parameterized as a function of solar zenith angle, aerosol type, atmospheric visibility, and vertically integrated water vapor and ozone amounts. When compared with the radiative transfer model of Tanre et al. (1979), the formula shows excellent agreement (to within 1\%) under most atmospheric conditions and solar zenith angles. There is also good agreement with formulas developed by other investigators to estimate total solar irradiance. Comparisons of calculated and measured total and photosynthetically available solar irradiances for several experiments in both tropical and mid-latitude oceanic regions show 39 and 14 Wm -2 rms errors (6.5 and 4.7\% of the average measured values) on an hourly time scale, respectively.  The proposed formula is unique in its ability to predict surface solar irradiance in the photosynthetically active spectral interval. Furthermore, it may also be used for converting total irradiance measurements into photosynthetically available irradiance estimates. Combining the clear sky irradiance formula with satellite techniques to retrieve cloud effect on solar irradiance, pigment concentration, and sea surface temperature would provide useful primary productivity estimates over large oceanic areas and eventually the global oceans.",

    abstract = "Irradiations of selected hydrocarbon-NO,-air mixtures were carried out over the temperature range -3 to 60 C in a 5800-L, thermostated evacuable environmental chamber. The federal air quality standard for ozone, 0.08 ppm (1-h average), was exceeded within 6 h of irradiation of a surrogate hydrocarbon-NO, mixture approximating an urban atmosphere, even at 5 C. In all three systems studied (propene, toluene, and surrogate), rates of ozone formation increased significantly with temperature. In propene-NO,-air and in toluene-NO,-air reaction mixtures, the amounts of hydrocarbon consumed and the approximate amounts of NO to NO2 conversion increased significantly with temperature. The nature of the 03 concentration-time profiles in high concentration propene-NO, experiments was significantly affected by temperature. In runs between 11 and 33 C, [O3] peaked slightly before most of the initially present NO, was consumed as is usually the case. However, for T I 11 C, [O3] peaked significantly earlier and, for T I 33 C, significantly later than the time of NO, consumption. Furthermore, in a run at T E 50 C, [03] reached a maximum prior to complete NO, consumption, then decreased slightly, and finally slowly increased to a second maximum. The mechanistic implications of these observations are discussed.",

For some pollutants, such as ozone, both observed and meteorologically adjusted trends are displayed. This paper describes an improved statistical methodology for meteorologically adjusting ozone trends as well as characterizes the relationships between individual meteorological parameters and ozone. A generalized linear model that accommodates the nonlinear effects of the meteorological variables was fit to data collected for 39 major eastern US urban areas. Overall, the model performs very well, yielding R2 statistics as high as 0.80. The analysis confirms that ozone is generally increasing with increasing temperature and decreasing with increasing relative humidity. Examination of the spatial gradients of these responses show that the effect of temperature on ozone is most pronounced in the north while the opposite is true of relative humidity. By including HYSPLIT-derived transport wind direction and distance in the model, it is shown that the largest incremental impact of wind direction on ozone occurs along the periphery of the study domain, which encompasses major NOx emission sources.

Using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model the variability of surface ozone levels from April to September for 4 years (1997, 2000, 2001, 2003) resulting from biogenic emissions is investigated. It is shown that BVOC emissions increased on average summer daily ozone maxima over Europe by 2.5 ppbv (5\%). The impact is most significant in Portugal (up to 15 ppbv) and in the Mediterranean region (about 5 ppbv), being smaller in the northern part of Europe (1.3 ppbv north of 47.5 N). The average impact is rather similar for the three summers (1997, 2000, 2001), but is much larger during the extraordinarily hot summer of 2003. Here, the biogenic contribution to surface ozone doubles compared to other years at some locations. Interaction with anthropogenic NOx emissions is found to be a key process for ozone production of biogenic precursors. Comparing the impact of the state-of-the-art BVOC emission inventory compiled within the NatAir project and an earlier, widely used BVOC inventory derived from Simpson et al. on surface ozone shows that ozone produced from biogenic precursors is less in central and northern Europe but in certain southern areas much higher e.g. Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea. The uncertainty in the regionally averaged impact of BVOC on ozone build-up in Europe is estimated to be +/-50\%. "

We employ gridded observed daily maximum temperatures and hourly ozone observations from nonurban stations across Europe, together with daily maximum temperatures for 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 from three regional climate models, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Reports on Emissions Scenarios A1B scenario. A rotated principal components analysis is applied to the ozone stations yielding five principal components, which divide the study domain in five subregions. The historical ozone-temperature relationship is examined and then used to provide estimates of future ozone exceedance days under current emissions and under the assumption that this relationship will retain its main characteristics. Results suggest that increases in the upper temperature percentiles lead to statistically significant increases (95\% statistical significance level) of the ozone exceedances for both future periods. The greatest average increases depending on the particular regional climate model range from 5 to 12 extra ozone days/yr for 2021–2050 and from 16 to 25 for 2071–2100, in southeast Europe. The lowest average increases range from 0 to 2 extra ozone days/yr for 2021–2050 and from 2 to 4 for 2071–2100 and are seen in northwest Europe. The simulations with the dynamical Goddard Institute of Space Studies/GEOS-CHEM climate chemistry modeling system shows decreases instead of increases in eastern Europe, higher increases in northwest Europe, whereas for the other subregions similar results to the statistical model are obtained.},

As a base case, the high ozone episode with up to 200ppb on 13 May 1998 was modelled and previously thoroughly evaluated with measurements gained during a large field experiment. Systematic variations in meteorology are applied to mixing height, air temperature, specific humidity and wind speed. Three coarser emission inventories are obtained by resampling from 3x3km2 up to 54x54km2 emission grids. The model results show that changes in meteorological input files strongly influence ozone in this area. For instance, temperature changes peak ozone by 10.1ppb/°C and the ozone concentrations in Milan by 2.8ppb/°C. The net ozone formation in northern Italy is more strongly temperature than humidity dependent, while the humidity is very important for the ROG/NOx limitation of the ozone production. For all meteorological changes (e.g. doubling the mixing height), the modelled peak ozone remains ROG limited. A strong change towards NOx sensitivity in the ROG limited areas is only found if much coarser emission inventories were applied. Increasing ROG limited areas with increasing wind speed are found, because the ROG limited ozone chemistry induced by point sources is spread over a larger area. Simulations without point sources tend to increase the NOx limited areas.",

To quantify the importance of meteorological parameters for the surface ozone concentration a nonlinear regression analysis between 313 meteorological candidate predictors and surface ozone concentration at five stations in the German Democratic Republic over the period 1972–1987 has been made. The stability and quality of the relationship between ozone and meteorological predictors has been tested by independent samples. Most important predictors for surface ozone are the ozone value of the preceding day (persistence) and solar radiation. They explain 33–46\% and 6–21\% of the climatological ozone variance, respectively. As all meteorological parameters can be forecasted, the regression method described might be the basis for a short-term prediction of surface ozone. An analysis of long-term changes of surface ozone and solar radiation shows that changes in cloudiness are probably not the main cause of the long-term changes in surface ozone. Therefore, the ozone changes should mainly be due to changes in circulation and/or concentration of ozone precursors (NOx, VOC)."

Several ground stations between the city of Milan and the Alps north of Milan combined with airborne measurements delivered a comprehensive data set suitable for observation-based analysis and validation of chemical transport models. The special section devoted to the PIPAPO project contains 10 contributions on the characterization of secondary aerosol formation, and radical precursors, and the characterization of ozone production sensitivity based on field measurements and numerical model simulations. In this paper the scientific background and the major objectives of PIPAPO are described. An overview of the field measurement program, the study site, and the meteorological conditions prevailing during the experiment are given. A general conclusion of the combined results is that under typical summer conditions in the Milan area with clear skies, low wind speeds and high temperatures, the transition from VOC- to NOx-sensitive ozone production occurs a few tens of kilometers downwind of the strongest emission sources in the city of Milan.},

It was found that northerly winds are connected with low relative humidity and small differences in potential temperature between the Jungfraujoch (3600 m above sea level (asl)) and Mendrisio (350 m asl) and therefore are primarily caused by North Foehn. This confirms that North Foehn transports air masses from high altitudes above the Alpine crest down into the lower boundary layer. On days with North Foehn the yearly cycles of ozone are very similar at Jungfraujoch and Mendrisio, around 40 ppb in winter and 60 ppb in summer. Compared to the whole data set in Mendrisio, these values are, at comparable temperatures, high in winter and very low in summer, when ozone concentrations often exceed 120 ppb during daytime. In contrast, during nighttime the North Foehn causes an enhancement of the ozone concentration near the ground during the whole year. The frequencies of the North Foehn events are 4–6\% from May to October and 6–10\% from November to April. Thus North Foehn is an important process for the ozone concentrations in the Po Basin.},

Calculations show that the concentration of ozone and non-volatile secondary particulate matter will generally increase at higher temperatures due to increased gas-phase reaction rates. The concentration of semi-volatile reaction products also will increase at higher temperatures, but the amount of this material that partitions to the particle-phase may decrease as equilibrium vapor pressures rise. Calculations performed for Southern California on September 25, 1996 predict that intraannual temperature variability may cause peak ozone and PM2.5 concentrations to fluctuate by up to 16\% and 25\% respectively. 24-hour average PM2.5 concentrations will decrease with increasing temperatures for inland portions of the South Coast air basin during most of the day. Slight increases in 24-hour average PM2.5 concentrations were predicted for coastal regions. The majority of the predicted shift in PM2.5 concentrations was related to increased production rates for nitric acid and condensable organic compounds balanced against increased volatilization of these products. Semi-volatile particulate ammonium nitrate concentrations are most sensitive to volatilization losses at hotter temperatures and when the ratio of gas-phase ammonia to nitric acid concentrations is approximately unity. Background sulfate particles and particles released from non-catalyst equipped gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, and food cooking were shifted to smaller sizes as ammonium nitrate volatilized at hotter temperatures.},

The concentrations of PAN ranged from <0.010 to 9.2 parts-per-billion by volume (ppbv) and those of O3 ranged from <2 to 139 ppbv. Diurnal concentration profiles showed PAN and O3 to be removed within nocturnal boundary layers, especially if nitric oxide was present, and that O3 was, for most sites, more rapidly removed than PAN. The only mountain top site at which PAN was measured showed distinctly different diurnal profiles in which O3 was actually higher at night, suggesting that convective flow driven by surface cooling served to transport air down from higher in the mixed layer at night. The afternoon production of PAN and O3 was also apparent and led to an overall linear correlation of O3 and PAN between the hours of 1300 and 1800. The comparison of this result with other measurements, estimates of PAN formation rates, and model calculations indicates that the production of PAN relative to ozone is far greater (x3) than can be accounted for by acetaldehyde reactions with OH, there is a wide disparity in model descriptions of PAN production, and confirms the non-linear dependence of O3 production on NOx.},

Moreover, the composite hourly averages of PAN and O3 for the entire measurement period showed an even stronger correlation of R = 0.95. The strong correlation between O3 and PAN suggest that mesoscale photochemical production plays a major role in PAN chemistry at site SONIA.

Previous results from other locations suggest that ratios such as O3/NOy and H2O2/HNO3 might provide measurement-based indicators for NOx-sensitive or VOC-sensitive conditions. Mexico City presents a different environment due to its high concentrations of VOC and high level of pollutants in general. The model predicts a correlation between PAN and O3 with relatively high PAN/O3 (0.07), which is still lower than measured values. The model PAN is comparable with results from a model for Paris but much higher than were found in Nashville in both models and measurements. The difference is due in part to the lower temperature in Mexico City relative to Nashville. Model HNO3 in Mexico City is unusually low for an urban area and PAN/HNO3 is very high, probably due to the high ratio of reactivity-weighted VOC to NOx. The model predicts that VOC-sensitive chemistry in Mexico is associated with high NOx, NOy and NOx/NOy and with low O3/NOy and H2O2/HNO3, suggesting that these indicators work well for Mexico City. The relation between ozone-precursor sensitivity and either O3/NOz or O3/HNO3 is more ambiguous. VOC-sensitive conditions are associated with higher O3/HNO3 than would be found in NOx-sensitive conditions, but model O3/HNO3 associated with both NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry is higher in Mexico than in other cities. The model predicts a mixed pattern of ozone-precursor sensitivity in Mexico City, with VOC-sensitive conditions in the morning and NOx-sensitive in the afternoon, in contrast to results from other models for more recent events that predicted strongly VOC- sensitive conditions throughout the day. The difference in predicted ozone-precursor sensitivity is most likely due to different emission rates and to changes in emissions over time. The model with mixed sensitivity predicts much lower ambient NOx and NOx/NOy than the strongly VOC-sensitive model.",

An effective photochemical age for an urban plume was introduced, which accounts for a background NOz concentration. Only the effective photochemical age of the urban air mass increased with the time of transport between Zurich and the flight leg, where the aircraft crossed the plume. Ozone and NOz were strongly correlated. Ozone production rates ranged from 2.4 to 6.5 ozone molecules produced per NOx processed. The production of ozone per NOx molecule was lowest when the effective photochemical age was lowest and vice versa. Good correlations between HCHO and NOy have been found in the urban plume of Zurich as well as over the Swiss Plateau. Between H2O2 and NOz, a negative correlation was observed. On the basis of Sillman's [1995] indicator species, the ozone production in the Zurich plume and other air masses over the Swiss Plateau is in the NOx-sensitive range. However, there remains some uncertainty in this approach regarding the influence of biogenic emissions and the initial concentration of indicator species. Taking the low emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons compared to Sillman's model calculation into consideration, the central portion of the Zurich plume falls in the transition or even reactive organic gases (ROG)- limited range of all indicators. Estimates of production rates of HNO3 and peroxides support a ROG-sensitive ozone production in the most polluted portion of the plume.},

In this study we examine predictions from the Carbon Bond 4 mechanism, the Regional Acid Deposition Model 2 mechanism, and an explicit mechanism used in global modeling. Several reactions are identified which influence the concentrations of important NOy species. The most important reaction under rural conditions is the oxidation of isoprene, which influences the production of PAN and organic nitrate. Differences among mechanisms cause large differences in the NOy concentrations, which propagate throughout the entire mechanism, affecting the chemistry of all species. The largest differences in NOy species among the mechanisms occur in the rural simulations, while predictions are the most similar under urban conditions, for which photochemical mechanisms have been studied and evaluated. The differences in NOy speciation cause uncertainties in the use of these mechanisms for predicting oxidant chemistry over long distances and multi-day episodes under non-urban conditions. Predictions from all mechanisms should be regarded with caution under rural conditions. "

    abstract = {Observations of total alkyl nitrates (ΣANs) were obtained using thermal dissociation-laser-induced fluorescence at La Porte, Texas, from 15 August to 15 September 2000, along with an extensive suite of other nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and O3. The ΣAN mixing ratios ranged as high as 5.2 ppbv. The median midday mixing ratio was 1.2 ppbv, and the median nighttime mixing ratio was 0.26 ppbv. These are higher mixing ratios than the sum of individual nitrates in virtually every prior study. The diurnal variation of ΣANs was similar to that of HNO3 and of total peroxy nitrates, with a peak near 1300 local time (LT) indicating a photochemical source. Mixing ratios decreased rapidly in the afternoon, suggesting that ΣAN deposition is nearly as fast as HNO3 deposition. The observed correlation between O3 and ΣANs has a slope that increases from 29 (R2 = 0.73) ΔOx/ΔΣANs at 0900–1200 LT to 41 (R2 = 0.74) ΔOx/ΔΣANs at 1400–1800 LT. We present calculations constrained by the observed hydrocarbons showing that both the mixing ratio of ΣANs and the correlation of ΣANs with O3 are to be expected on the basis of the branching ratios for alkyl nitrate formation in the RO2 + NO reaction.},

    abstract = {The formation of organic nitrates during the oxidation of the biogenic hydrocarbon isoprene can strongly affect boundary layer concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2). We constrain uncertainties in the chemistry of these isoprene nitrates using chemical transport model simulations in conjunction with observations over the eastern United States from the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) field campaign during summer 2004. The model best captures the observed boundary layer concentrations of organic nitrates and their correlation with ozone using a 4\% yield of isoprene nitrate production from the reaction of isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO, a recycling of 40\% NOx when isoprene nitrates react with OH and ozone, and a fast dry deposition rate of isoprene nitrates. Simulated boundary layer concentrations are only weakly sensitive to the rate of photochemical loss of the isoprene nitrates. An 8\% yield of isoprene nitrates degrades agreement with the observations somewhat, but concentrations are still within 50\% of observations and thus cannot be ruled out by this study. Our results indicate that complete recycling of NOx from the reactions of isoprene nitrates and slow rates of isoprene nitrate deposition are incompatible with the observations. We find that ∼50\% of the isoprene nitrate production in the model occurs via reactions of isoprene (or its oxidation products) with the NO3 radical, but note that the isoprene nitrate yield from this pathway is highly uncertain. Using recent estimates of rapid reaction rates with ozone, 20–24\% of isoprene nitrates are lost via this pathway, implying that ozonolysis is an important loss process for isoprene nitrates. Isoprene nitrates are shown to have a major impact on the nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) budget in the summertime U.S. continental boundary layer, consuming 15–19\% of the emitted NOx, of which 4–6\% is recycled back to NOx and the remainder is exported as isoprene nitrates (2–3\%) or deposited (8–10\%). Our constraints on reaction rates, branching ratios, and deposition rates need to be confirmed through further laboratory and field measurements. The model systematically underestimates free tropospheric concentrations of organic nitrates, indicating a need for future investigation of the processes controlling the observed distribution.},

    abstract = { Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the “O3–climate penalty” has generally decreased over the past three decades, which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O3–climate penalty to reductions in NOx emissions but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here, we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O3–climate penalty under varying NOx and VOC emissions in both NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O3 precursors will not diminish the O3–climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NOx-limited air basin, NOx control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O3–climate penalty and mitigate O3 pollution, while in a NOx-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NOx and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O3–climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O3 concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O3–climate penalty as NOx and VOC emissions evolve in other regions. }

Increasing temperature with no change in absolute humidity promoted the formation of O3 by +2 to +9 ppb K−1 through increased reaction rates. Increasing temperature with no change in relative humidity increased predicted O3 concentrations by +2 to +15 ppb K−1 through enhanced production of hydroxyl radical combined with increased reaction rates. Increasing mixing depth promoted the formation of O3 in regions with an over-abundance of fresh NO emissions (such as central Los Angeles) by providing extra dilution. Increasing temperature with no change in absolute humidity reduced particle water content and promoted the evaporation of ammonium nitrate at a rate of −3 to −7 μg m−3 K−1. Increasing temperature with no change in relative humidity maintained particle water content and moderated ammonium nitrate evaporation rates to a maximum value of −3 μg m−3 K−1 during warmer episodes and increased ammonium nitrate condensation by +1.5 μg m−3 K −1 during colder episodes. Increasing mixing depth reduced the concentration of primary particulate matter but increased the formation of secondary particulate matter in regions with an over-abundance of fresh NO emissions. O3 transported into California from upwind areas enhanced the formation of particulate nitrate by promoting the formation of N2O5 and HNO3 at night. A 30 ppb increase in background O3 concentrations (roughly doubling current levels) increased maximum PM2.5 concentrations by +7 to +16 μg m−3 even when temperature was simultaneously increased by +5 K with no change in absolute humidity (most unfavorable conditions for nitrate formation)."

In this review, laboratory studies of this peroxy radical chemistry are detailed, as they pertain to the chemistry of the atmosphere. First, a brief discussion of methods used to detect the peroxy radicals in the laboratory is presented. Then, the basic reaction pathways - involving RO2 unimolecular reactions and bimolecular reactions with atmospheric constituents such as NO, NO2, NO3, O3, halogen oxides, HO2, and other RO2 species - are discussed. For each of these reaction pathways, basic reaction rates are presented, along with trends in reactivity with radical structure. Focus is placed on recent advances in detection methods and on recent advances in our understanding of radical cycling processes, particularly pertaining to the complex chemistry associated with the atmospheric oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons."

    abstract = "We have evaluated tropospheric ozone enhancement in air dominated by biomass burning emissions at high latitudes (> 50° N) in July 2008, using 10 global chemical transport model simulations from the POLMIP multi-model comparison exercise. In model air masses dominated by fire emissions, ΔO3/ΔCO values ranged between 0.039 and 0.196 ppbv ppbv−1 (mean: 0.113 ppbv ppbv−1) in freshly fire-influenced air, and between 0.140 and 0.261 ppbv ppbv−1 (mean: 0.193 ppbv) in more aged fire-influenced air. These values are in broad agreement with the range of observational estimates from the literature. Model ΔPAN/ΔCO enhancement ratios show distinct groupings according to the meteorological data used to drive the models. ECMWF-forced models produce larger ΔPAN/ΔCO values (4.47 to 7.00 pptv ppbv−1) than GEOS5-forced models (1.87 to 3.28 pptv ppbv−1), which we show is likely linked to differences in efficiency of vertical transport during poleward export from mid-latitude source regions. Simulations of a large plume of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions exported from towards the Arctic using a Lagrangian chemical transport model show that 4-day net ozone change in the plume is sensitive to differences in plume chemical composition and plume vertical position among the POLMIP models. In particular, Arctic ozone evolution in the plume is highly sensitive to initial concentrations of PAN, as well as oxygenated VOCs (acetone, acetaldehyde), due to their role in producing the peroxyacetyl radical PAN precursor. Vertical displacement is also important due to its effects on the stability of PAN, and subsequent effect on NOx abundance. In plumes where net ozone production is limited, we find that the lifetime of ozone in the plume is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide loading, due to the production of HOx from peroxide photolysis, and the key role of HO2 + O3 in controlling ozone loss. Overall, our results suggest that emissions from biomass burning lead to large-scale photochemical enhancement in high-latitude tropospheric ozone during summer."

    abstract = "Isoprene is a~precursor to tropospheric ozone, a key pollutant and greenhouse gas. Anthropogenic activity over the coming century is likely to cause large changes in atmospheric CO2 levels, climate and land use, all of which will alter the global vegetation distribution leading to changes in isoprene emissions. Previous studies have used global chemistry–climate models to assess how possible changes in climate and land use could affect isoprene emissions and hence tropospheric ozone. The chemistry of isoprene oxidation, which can alter the concentration of ozone, is highly complex, therefore it must be parameterised in these models. In this work, we compare the effect of four different reduced isoprene chemical mechanisms, all currently used in Earth system models, on tropospheric ozone. Using a box model we compare ozone in these reduced schemes to that in a more explicit scheme (the Master Chemical Mechanism) over a range of NOx and isoprene emissions, through the use of O3 isopleths. We find that there is some variability, especially at high isoprene emissions, caused by differences in isoprene-derived NOx reservoir species. A global model is then used to examine how the different reduced schemes respond to potential future changes in climate, isoprene emissions, anthropogenic emissions and land use change. We find that, particularly in isoprene-rich regions, the response of the schemes varies considerably. The wide-ranging response is due to differences in the model descriptions of the peroxy radical chemistry, particularly their relative rates of reaction towards NO, leading to ozone formation, or HO2, leading to termination. Also important is the yield of isoprene nitrates and peroxyacyl nitrate precursors from isoprene oxidation. Those schemes that produce less of these NOx reservoir species, tend to produce more ozone locally and less away from the source region. We also note changes in other key oxidants such as NO3 and OH (due to the inclusion of additional isoprene-derived HOx recycling pathways). These have implications for secondary organic aerosol formation, as does the inclusion of an epoxide formation pathway in one of the mechanisms. By combining the emissions and O3 data from all of the global model integrations, we are able to construct isopleth plots comparable to those from the box model analysis. We find that the global and box model isopleths show good qualitative agreement, suggesting that comparing chemical mechanisms with a box model in this framework is a useful tool for assessing mechanistic performance in complex global models. We conclude that as the choice of reduced isoprene mechanism may alter both the magnitude and sign of the ozone response, how isoprene chemistry is parameterised in perturbation experiments such as these is a crucially important consideration. More measurements and laboratory studies are needed to validate these reduced mechanisms especially under high-volatile-organic-compound, low-NOx conditions."

The C3–C4 (rather than C1–C2) RONO2 were most abundant throughout the study, showing the importance of photochemical (rather than marine) RONO2 production in the sampled air. A lack of methyl nitrate (MeONO2) enhancement during summer, when the prevailing winds are from the ocean, indicates that the South China Sea is not a region of strong RONO2 emissions. By contrast, MeONO2 levels during pollution episodes (up to 25 parts per trillion by volume (pptv)) were the highest that our group has recorded during urban photochemical RONO2 production, as opposed to marine emissions or biomass burning. The highest summed RONO2 level of the study (204 pptv) was measured in the afternoon of 7 November 2002, during an intense pollution episode that captured the highest ozone (O3) level ever recorded in Hong Kong (203 ppbv). During pollution episodes, the average ratio of O3 to summed RONO2 was roughly 1000:1 in freshly polluted air (ethyne/CO∼3–5 pptv/ppbv) and 500:1 in very freshly polluted air (ethyne/CO∼6–8 pptv/ppbv). Ozone and RONO2 share a common photochemical source, and their good correlation in pollution plumes shows that RONO2 can be used as a tracer of photochemical O3 production. Even MeONO2 showed similar diurnal variations as the C2–C5 RONO2, indicating a strong photochemical source despite its very slow photochemical production from methane oxidation. The decomposition of longer-chain alkoxy radicals also does not explain the high MeONO2 levels, and rough calculations show that methoxy radical reaction with NO2 appears to be a viable alternate pathway for MeONO2 production in polluted atmospheres, though further measurements and modeling are required to confirm this mechanism.

We perform a statistical analysis of 21 years of ozone and temperature observations across the rural eastern U.S. The climate penalty factor is defined as the slope of the ozone/temperature relationship. For two precursor emission regimes, before and after 2002, the climate penalty factor was consistent across the distribution of ozone observations. Prior to 2002, ozone increased by an average of ∼3.2 ppbv/°C. After 2002, power plant NOx emissions were reduced by 43\%, ozone levels fell ∼10\%, and the climate penalty factor dropped to ∼2.2 ppbv/°C. NOx controls are effective for reducing photochemical smog and might lessen the severity of projected climate change penalties. Air quality models should be evaluated against these observations, and the climate penalty factor metric may be useful for evaluating the response of ozone to climate change.}

As a result of its high reactivity, isoprene is an important ozone precursor in the troposphere and can play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. Measurements of isoprene in urban areas in Central Europe are scarce. Thus, in Essen, Germany, the isoprene concentration was measured at various sites during different seasons using two compact online GC-PID systems. Isoprene concentrations were compared with those of benzene and toluene, which represent typical anthropogenic VOCs. In the summer, the diurnal variation in isoprene concentration was dependent on the biogenic emissions in the city. It was found that its maximum concentration occurred during the day, in contrast to the benzene and toluene concentrations. During the measurement period in the summer of 2012, the average hourly isoprene concentrations reached 0.13 to 0.17 ppb between 10 and 20 LST. At high air temperatures, the isoprene concentration exceeded the benzene and toluene concentrations at many of the sites. Isoprene became more important than toluene with regard to ozone formation in the city area during the afternoon hours of summer days with high air temperatures. This finding was demonstrated by the contributions to OH reactivity and ozone-forming potential. It contradicts the results of other studies, which were based on daily or seasonal average values. With an isoprene/benzene ratio of 0.02, the contribution of anthropogenic isoprene decreased substantially to a very low level during the last 20 years in Central Europe due to a strong reduction in road traffic emissions. In the vicinity of many people, isoprene concentrations of up to 0.54 ppb and isoprene/benzene ratios of up to 1.34 were found in the atmosphere due to isoprene exhaled by humans. "

The highest concentrations of isoprene and monoterpenes were measured in summer (990 ng m−3), but concentrations were also clearly above the detection limit in winter (230 ng m−3). The concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons were higher during all seasons, but when viewed in terms of reactivity-scaled concentrations the data showed that also isoprene and monoterpenes have a strong influence on local atmospheric chemistry in urban air. While they explain 71\% of the potential hydroxyl radical reactivity of air masses in summer, they still explain 32\% of the reactivity also in winter. In winter and spring the urban background concentrations were higher than at a forested site in Finland, indicating anthropogenic sources of isoprene and monoterpenes. Source estimates obtained with the Unmix multivariate receptor model showed that traffic and wood combustion are the main local contributors to the measured concentration levels in winter, spring and November, but in July and October biogenic sources are dominant.

    abstract = "Ground level ozone concentrations ([O3]) typically show a direct linear relationship with surface air temperature. Three decades of California measurements provide evidence of a statistically significant change in the ozone-temperature slope (ΔmO3-T) under extremely high temperatures (> 312 K). This ΔmO3-T leads to a plateau or decrease in [O3], reflecting the diminished role of nitrogen oxide sequestration by peroxyacetyl nitrates and reduced biogenic isoprene emissions at high temperatures. Despite inclusion of these processes in global and regional chemistry-climate models, a statistically significant change in ΔmO3-T has not been noted in prior studies. Future climate projections suggest a more frequent and spatially widespread occurrence of this ΔmO3-T response, confounding predictions of extreme ozone events based on the historically observed linear relationship."

    abstract = "Atmospheric chemistry plays a key role in determining the amounts and distributions of oxidants and gaseous precursors that control the formation of secondary gaseous and aerosol pollutants; all of those species can interact with the climate system. To understand the impacts of different gas-phase mechanisms on global air quality and climate predictions, in this work, a comprehensive comparative evaluation is performed using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) Version 5 with comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (CAM5-chem) within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with the two most commonly used gas-phase chemical mechanisms: the 2005 Carbon Bond mechanism with Global Extension (CB05_GE) and the Model of OZone and Related chemical Tracers version 4 (MOZART-4) mechanism with additional updates (MOZART-4x). MOZART-4x and CB05_GE use different approaches to represent volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and different surrogates for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors. MOZART-4x includes a more detailed representation of isoprene chemistry compared to CB05_GE. CB05_GE includes additional oxidation of SO2 by O3 over the surface of dust particles, which is not included in MOZART-4x. The results show that the two CAM5-chem simulations with CB05_GE and MOZART-4x predict similar chemical profiles for major gases (e.g., O3, CO, and NOx) compared to the aircraft measurements, with generally better agreement for NOy profiles by CB05_GE than MOZART-4x. The concentrations of SOA at four sites in the continental US (CONUS) and organic carbon (OC) over the IMPROVE sites are well predicted by MOZART-4x (with normalized mean biases (NMBs) of −1.9 and 2.1 \%, respectively) but moderately underpredicted by CB05_GE (with NMBs of −23.1 and −20.7 \%, respectively). This is mainly due to the higher biogenic emissions and OH levels simulated with MOZART-4x than with CB05_GE. The concentrations of OC over Europe are largely underpredicted by both MOZART-4x and CB05_GE, with NMBs of −73.0 and −75.1 \%, respectively, indicating the uncertainties in the emissions of precursors and primary OC and relevant model treatments such as the oxidations of VOCs and SOA formation. Uncertainties in the emissions and convection scheme can contribute to the large bias in the model predictions (e.g., SO2, CO, black carbon, and aerosol optical depth). The two simulations also have similar cloud/radiative predictions, with a slightly better performance of domain average cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at supersaturation of 0.5 \% by CB05_GE, but slightly better agreement with observed CCN (at supersaturation of 0.2 \%) profile over Beijing by MOZART-4x. The two gas-phase mechanisms result in a global average difference of 0.5 W m−2 in simulated shortwave cloud radiative forcing, with significant differences (e.g., up to 13.6 W m−2) over subtropical regions.",

    abstract = {Using the 11-level Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global chemical transport model (GCTM) with all known sources of tropospheric NOx, we simulate the global tropospheric distribution of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and quantify its impact on tropospheric NOx. The model's global distribution of PAN is in reasonable agreement with most available observations. In the atmospheric boundary layer, PAN is concentrated over the continental sites of NOx emissions, primarily the midlatitudes in the northern hemisphere and the subtropics in the southern hemisphere. PAN is distributed relatively zonally throughout the free troposphere of the northern hemisphere, with the maximum levels found in the coldest regions, while in the southern hemisphere the maximum PAN levels are found in an equator to 30°S belt stretching from South America to Australia. Overall, the simulated three-dimensional fields of seasonal PAN are a result of the interaction of the type of transport meteorology (convective or synoptic scale storms) occurring in the PAN formation regions and PAN's temperature-dependent lifetime. We find the impact of PAN chemistry on NOx to be rather subtle. The magnitude and the seasonal cycle of the global tropospheric integral of NOx, which has its maximum in January and the formation of HNO3 as its dominant loss path, are barely affected by the inclusion of PAN chemistry, however PAN, as a result of its temperature sensitivity and transport, regionally provides an efficient mechanism for redistributing NOx far from its source areas. With the inclusion of PAN chemistry, monthly mean NOx concentrations increase by up to a factor of 5 in the remote lower troposphere and show a spring maximum over areas of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. In contrast, PAN has only a minor impact in the upper half of the troposphere (±10\%). Examining local time series of NOx and PAN, the monthly mean mixing ratios in remote regions are shown to be composed of numerous short-term (1–2 days) large magnitude events. These episodes are large enough to potentially result in ozone production even when the monthly mean NOx values are in the ozone destruction range. While both the direct transport of NOx and its indirect transport as PAN contribute to the elevated NOx episodes over the remote extratropical oceans, events over the remote subtropical oceans are dominated by midtropospheric PAN that sinks anticyclonically equatorward and decomposes to NOx in the warmer air.},

Models are evaluated against hourly surface ozone from 4217 stations in North America and Europe that are averaged over 1° × 1° grid cells, allowing commensurate model–measurement comparison. Models are generally biased high during all hours of the day and in all regions. Most models simulate the shape of regional summertime diurnal and annual cycles well, correctly matching the timing of hourly (~ 15:00 local time (LT)) and monthly (mid-June) peak surface ozone abundance. The amplitude of these cycles is less successfully matched. The observed summertime diurnal range (~ 25 ppb) is underestimated in all regions by about 7 ppb, and the observed seasonal range (~ 21 ppb) is underestimated by about 5 ppb except in the most polluted regions, where it is overestimated by about 5 ppb. The models generally match the pattern of the observed summertime ozone enhancement, but they overestimate its magnitude in most regions. Most models capture the observed distribution of extreme episode sizes, correctly showing that about 80 \% of individual extreme events occur in large-scale, multi-day episodes of more than 100 grid cells. The models also match the observed linear relationship between episode size and a measure of episode intensity, which shows increases in ozone abundance by up to 6 ppb for larger-sized episodes. We conclude that the skill of the models evaluated here provides confidence in their projections of future surface ozone."

A composite liquid fuel speciation profile was determined from gasoline samples collected at Sacramento area service stations. Vapor-liquid equilibrium relationships were used to determine the corresponding headspace vapor composition. VOC concentrations measured in a highway tunnel were used to define the composition of running vehicle emissions. The chemical mass balance analysis indicated that headspace vapor contributions ranged from 7 to 29\% of total vehicle-related VOC depending on time of day and day of week, with a mean daytime contribution of 17.0 ± 0.9\% (mean ± 95\% CI). A positive association between the headspace vapor contribution and ambient air temperature was found for afternoon hours.

Due to its short lifetime, and dependence on sunlight and precursor emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources, tropospheric ozone’s abundance is highly variable in space and time on seasonal, interannual and decadal time-scales. Recent, and sometimes rapid, changes in observed ozone mixing ratios and ozone precursor emissions inspired us to produce this up-to-date overview of tropospheric ozone’s global distribution and trends. Much of the text is a synthesis of in situ and remotely sensed ozone observations reported in the peer-reviewed literature, but we also include some new and extended analyses using well-known and referenced datasets to draw connections between ozone trends and distributions in different regions of the world. In addition, we provide a brief evaluation of the accuracy of rural or remote surface ozone trends calculated by three state-of-the-science chemistry-climate models, the tools used by scientists to fill the gaps in our knowledge of global tropospheric ozone distribution and trends."

Estimates of f-NO2 have also been derived from ambient monitoring data at roadside sites in each case study location using a model. The results of the analysis of trends show that f-NO2 has increased in recent years and that the rate of increase has been greatest since 2000. f-NO2 has increased from 8.6\% in 2000 to 12.4\% in 2004 as an average across the monitoring sites and from an average of 6.3\% in 2000 to 10.6\% in 2005 as an average of the emission inventory based calculations for the case study countries. f-NO2 is predicted to increase further to an average of 19.6\% in 2010 and 32.0\% in 2020 as a result of the further penetration of exhaust after treatment technologies for diesel vehicles in the fleets. This increase is expected to be offset by the large reduction in NOx emissions over this period, resulting in an increase in NO2 emissions from road traffic to 2015, followed by a decline to close to 2004 levels by 2020. Estimates of future ambient NO2 concentrations have also been calculated for the roadside monitoring sites included in the study. At 29 out of 45 of these sites the annual mean NO2 limit value is predicted to be exceeded in 2010. At 22 of these sites, the annual mean concentration is expected to remain above the limit value until 2020 and beyond. "

By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven approaches and ecosystem models overestimate total natural emissions. We build three contrasting emission scenarios [mdash] which differ in fossil fuel and microbial emissions [mdash] to explain the decadal variability in atmospheric methane levels detected, here and in previous studies, since 1985. Although uncertainties in emission trends do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, we show that the observed stabilization of methane levels between 1999 and 2006 can potentially be explained by decreasing-to-stable fossil fuel emissions, combined with stable-to-increasing microbial emissions. We show that a rise in natural wetland emissions and fossil fuel emissions probably accounts for the renewed increase in global methane levels after 2006, although the relative contribution of these two sources remains uncertain."

Uncertainty in any of these influences or the underlying processes implies uncertainty in future abundance and radiative forcing. We simulate methane lifetime in three chemical transport models (CTMs) – UCI CTM, GEOS-Chem, and Oslo CTM3 – over the period 1997–2009 and compare the models' year-to-year variability against constraints from global methyl chloroform observations. Using sensitivity tests, we find that temperature, water vapor, stratospheric ozone column, biomass burning and lightning NOx are the dominant sources of interannual changes in methane lifetime in all three models. We also evaluate each model's response to forcings that have impacts on decadal time scales, such as methane feedback, and anthropogenic emissions. In general, these different CTMs show similar sensitivities to the driving variables. We construct a parametric model that reproduces most of the interannual variability of each CTM and use it to predict methane lifetime from 1980 through 2100 following a specified emissions and climate scenario (RCP 8.5). The parametric model propagates uncertainties through all steps and provides a foundation for predicting methane abundances in any climate scenario. Our sensitivity tests also enable a new estimate of the methane global warming potential (GWP), accounting for stratospheric ozone effects, including those mediated by water vapor. We estimate the 100-yr GWP to be 32, which is 25\% larger than past assessments."

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations."

Here we investigate a 12 year record of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in central London and the importance of biogenics (in the form of isoprene) for ozone formation through the contribution to OH reactivity. Significant reductions in NMHCs were observed from 1998 through 2009 at an urban traffic site (−13\% per year) and suburban background site (−5\% per year) in London. Total isoprene levels decreased similarly and the relative contribution of isoprene to the total NMHC OH reactivity did not change. Furthermore, a dataset for Paris showed strong similarities to the data from London, which would indicate that these results are not limited to London. Interestingly, a rural site to the east of London, Harwell, showed similar contributions of isoprene to the total NMHC reactivity, which may indicate the need for measurements of other biogenic species, such as monoterpenes, in some areas to reliably capture the importance of biogenics in the region. These results would indicate that the influence of biogenic isoprene in London, and likely other low isoprene emitter urban areas have a long way to go before the importance of biogenic VOCs equals or exceeds that of anthropogenic contributions.},

Along with local meteorological conditions, the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on surface ozone is addressed through a set of airflow indices computed with a novel implementation of a grid-by-grid weather type classification across Europe. Drivers of surface ozone over the full distribution of maximum daily 8 h average values are investigated, along with drivers of the extreme high percentiles and exceedances or air quality guideline thresholds. Three different regression techniques are applied: multiple linear regression to assess the drivers of maximum daily ozone, logistic regression to assess the probability of threshold exceedances and quantile regression to estimate the meteorological influence on extreme values, as represented by the 95th percentile. The relative importance of the input parameters (predictors) is assessed by a backward stepwise regression procedure that allows the identification of the most important predictors in each model. Spatial patterns of model performance exhibit distinct variations between regions. The inclusion of the ozone persistence is particularly relevant over southern Europe. In general, the best model performance is found over central Europe, where the maximum temperature plays an important role as a driver of maximum daily ozone as well as its extreme values, especially during warmer months.}

    abstract = {I present an analysis of ozonesonde data, synthesizing what is known about the distribution of tropospheric ozone. Major features of the distribution are highlighted, and recommendations are given for testing three-dimensional models of tropospheric chemistry and transport with these data. The data are analyzed on pressure surfaces and relative to the height of the thermal tropopause. A minimum of 20 soundings are required for 95\% confidence intervals of the ozone monthly means to be less than ±30\% near the extratropical tropopause. Twenty soundings also ensures means reliable to better than ±15\% for 800–500 hPa for the extratropics and for 800–100 hPa in the tropics. Ozone variability is higher in the upper troposphere for subtropical locations than for tropical locations, and 35 soundings are required for 400–100 hPa for the means to be defined to better than ±15\%. For northern middle and high latitudes, the broad summer maximum in ozone in the middle troposphere extends all the way up to the tropopause. Median concentrations at the tropopause are highest in June and July, typically 125–200 ppb, and are a factor of 2 smaller in winter. Highest values of ozone are in spring 2 km above the tropopause. The change in the phase of the annual cycle of ozone between the tropopause and the region immediately above it, and the steep concentration gradients across the tropopause, suggest that high vertical resolution (∼1 km) will be required in models to simulate this behavior. Mean ozone values in the middle troposphere are approximately constant from 30° to 75° in the winter in both hemispheres, while there is a maximum from 35° to 50°N in summer. In the northern subtropics, there is a summer minimum in middle tropospheric ozone over the Pacific and a summer maximum over the Atlantic which appear to be related to differences in circulation. Mean ozone values over Samoa are similar to those measured 20–30 years ago over Panama. Ozone is higher over the tropical South Atlantic (Natal) than over the western Pacific (Samoa) all year from about 800 hPa to the tropopause; ozone is most similar in May and June over the Atlantic and Pacific, the months with minimum burning in the tropics. The ozone maximum at Samoa in the middle and upper troposphere in October is caused by long-range transport of ozone and its precursors from biomass burning, with the peak lagging that at Natal by about a month. The secondary peak in ozone in January and December at South Atlantic sites reflects transport of biomass burning effluents from the Northern Hemisphere. The sonde data were used in combination with surface and satellite data to derive a gridded climatology for tropospheric ozone.},

GRE-CAPS consists of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) II' general circulation model with aerosol processes and ozone chemistry, the fifth-generation PSU/NCAR mesoscale model (MM5) regional meteorological model, and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) with aerosol (PM) processes developed at Carnegie Mellon University (PMCAMx) regional chemical transport model. A set of five present-day Januaries and six present-day Julys was simulated using GRE-CAPS. The present-day model predictions (2000s) were compared to model predictions for a set of five future Januaries and Julys. The future time period investigated was the 2050s, using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario. U.S. emissions of biogenic and anthropogenic precursors were held constant so that the effects of climate change alone could be calculated. Climate change led to a decrease in U.S. land cell average January PM2.5 concentrations of 0.3 μg m−3 and an increase of July PM2.5 of 2.5 μg m−3. The changes in PM in the Northeast were of the opposite sign of the domain-wide averages. The response in January was due largely to increased precipitation, while the response in July was due primarily to decreased ventilation, as indicated by decreases in mixing height and wind speed, with increases in sulfate being the largest response by a single species. The U.S. land cell average change in July daily maximum 8-h ozone concentration was +1.7 ppb, though the increases in cities in the Southeast were up to 15 ppb. In spite of the large differences in ozone in many areas, the changes in ozone concentration were not statistically significant over most of the domain because of large interannual variability. In separate simulations to test the sensitivity of ozone concentrations to biogenic emissions, a 25\% increase in biogenic U.S. volatile organic compound emissions led to an additional increase in land cell average ozone of 0.7 ppb, though the increased ozone resulting from increased biogenics was largely statistically insignificant.},

  abstract={Ozone air pollution is identified as one of the main threats bearing upon human health and ecosystems, with 25 000 deaths in 2005 attributed to surface ozone in Europe (IIASA 2013 TSAP Report #10). In addition, there is a concern that climate change could negate ozone pollution mitigation strategies, making them insufficient over the long run and jeopardising chances to meet the long term objective set by the European Union Directive of 2008 ( Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 ) (60 ppbv, daily maximum). This effect has been termed the ozone climate penalty. One way of assessing this climate penalty is by driving chemistry-transport models with future climate projections while holding the ozone precursor emissions constant (although the climate penalty may also be influenced by changes in emission of precursors). Here we present an analysis of the robustness of the climate penalty in Europe across time periods and scenarios by analysing the databases underlying 11 articles published on the topic since 2007, i.e. a total of 25 model projections. This substantial body of literature has never been explored to assess the uncertainty and robustness of the climate ozone penalty because of the use of different scenarios, time periods and ozone metrics. Despite the variability of model design and setup in this database of 25 model projection, the present meta-analysis demonstrates the significance and robustness of the impact of climate change on European surface ozone with a latitudinal gradient from a penalty bearing upon large parts of continental Europe and a benefit over the North Atlantic region of the domain. Future climate scenarios present a penalty for summertime (JJA) surface ozone by the end of the century (2071–2100) of at most 5 ppbv. Over European land surfaces, the 95\% confidence interval of JJA ozone change is [0.44; 0.64] and [0.99; 1.50] ppbv for the 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 time windows, respectively.}

    abstract = "The factors regulating summertime 03 over the United States and its export to the global atmosphere are examined with a 3-month simulation using a continental scale, three-dimensional photochemical model. It is found that reducing NOx emissions by 50\% from 1985 levels would decrease rural 03 concentrations over the eastern United States by about 15\% under almost all meteorological conditions, while reducing anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions by 50\% would have less than a 4\% effect except in the largest urban plumes. The strongly NOx-limited conditions in the model reflect the dominance of rural areas as sources of 03 on the regional scale. The correlation between 03 concentrations and temperature observed at eastern U.S. sites is attributed in part to the association of high temperatures with regional stagnation, and in part to an actual dependence of 03 production on temperature driven primarily by conversion of NOx to peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN).  The net number of 03 molecules produced per molecule of NOx consumed (net 03 production efficiency, accounting for both chemical production and chemical loss of 03) has a mean value of 6.3 in the U.S. boundary layer; it is 3 times higher in the western United States than in the east because of lower NOx concentrations in the west. Approximately 70\% of the net chemical production of 03 in the U.S. boundary layer is exported (the rest is deposited). Only 6\% of the NOx emitted in the United States is exported out of the U.S. boundary layer as NOx or PAN, but this export contributes disproportionately tototal U.S. influence on global tropospheric 03 because of the high 03 production efficiency per unit NOx in the remote troposphere. It is estimated that export of U.S. pollution supplies 8 Gmol 03 d -1 to the global troposphere in summer, including 4 Gmol d -1 from direct export of 03 out of the U.S. boundary layer and 4 Gmol d -1 from productionf 03 downwind ofthe United States due to exported NOx. This U.S. pollution source can be compared to estimates of 18-28 Gmol d -1 for the cross-tropopause transport of03 over the entire northern hemisphere in summe"

Firstly, the aim of this study was to perceive the daily, monthly and seasonal variation patterns of ozone concentrations. Diurnal cycles are presented by season and the fit of the data to a normal distribution is tested. In order to assess ozone behaviour under temperate weather conditions, local meteorological variables (wind direction and speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and rainfall) were monitored together with ozone concentrations. The main relationships we could observe in these analyses were then used to obtain a regression equation linking diurnal ozone concentrations in summer with meteorological parameters. "

    abstract = "Tropospheric ozone concentrations regarded as harmful for human health are frequently encountered in Central Europe in summertime. Although ozone formation generally results from precursors transported over long distances, in urban areas local effects, such as reactions due to nearby emission sources, play a major role in determining ozone concentrations. Europe-wide mapping and modeling of population exposure to high ozone concentrations is subject to many uncertainties, because small-scale phenomena in urban areas can significantly change ozone levels from those of the surroundings. Currently the integrated assessment modeling of European ozone control strategies is done utilizing the results of large-scale models intended for estimating the rural background ozone levels. This paper presents an initial study on how much local nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations can explain variations between large-scale ozone model results and urban ozone measurements, on one hand, and between urban and nearby rural measurements, on the other. The impact of urban NOx concentrations on ozone levels was derived from chemical equations describing the ozone balance. The study investigated the applicability of the method for improving the accuracy of modeled population exposure, which is needed for efficient control strategy development. The method was tested with NOx levels are a significant explanatory factor in differences between urban and nearby rural ozone concentrations and that the phenomenon could be satisfactorily represented with this kind of method. Further research efforts should comprise testing of the method in more locations and analyzing the performance of more widely applicable ways of deriving the initial parameters. "

The evaluation was conducted through the comparison of this inventory with hourly HC measurements during two summer months in the centre of Marseille, on the Mediterranean French coast. Factors of under or overestimation could be calculated for each compound on the basis of a systematic HC to HC ratio analysis. These results, associated with a deep analysis of the speciation profiles, show that most of the common and highly concentrated hydrocarbons (such as butanes) are too much predominant in the emission speciation, while the heavy and less common species (branched alkanes, substituted aromatics) are under-represented in the inventory. The urban diffuse sources appear here as one critical point of the inventories. The disagreements were shown to have a strong incidence on the representation of the air mass reactivity. In a last step, the identified uncertainties in emissions were implemented in an air-quality model for sensitivity studies. It was shown that the observed biases in the inventory could affect the regional ozone production, with a probable impact on ozone peaks of 2–10 ppbv over the area. "

The effects on air quality, radiative forcing and atmospheric oxidation capacity are disproportionately smaller than the proportion of anthropogenic emissions due to megacities. Disproportionately large effects of megacities are modelled for reactive nitrogen compounds, in particular PAN (peroxy acetyl nitrate), which has increased in abundance globally by 9\% due to megacities under year 2000 conditions, with 23\% of the Earth experiencing an increase of 10\% or more. These influences decrease under two very different future emission scenarios. Under a low-emission future scenario, the influence of megacities is generally reduced, and under a high-emission future scenario, although the local influence of megacities is increased, the geographical extent of the influence becomes smaller. In our model, the individual grid cells that contain megacities respond to the megacity emissions differently depending on their latitude. Tropical megacity grid cells generally show increased ozone year-round, while northern extratropical megacities generally show reduced ozone year-round. Better parameterisation of the sub-grid effects of megacities is an important issue for future work."
